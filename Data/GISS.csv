These ants were collected from two of the three Tokelau atolls. On the island of Fenua Fala of Fakaofo Atoll, long-legged ants appear to be a recent arrival and occur in only a small area around one of the two ports. Most of the inhabited islands of Vao and Motuhuga on Nukunonu Atoll have been invaded, in addition to several of the uninhabited, forested islands. Despite this ant having been previously recorded from at least one island of Fakaofo and Nukunonu, these appear to be new invasions. Densities ofup to 3,603 A. gracilipes per pitfall trap were caught per 24 hr. A significant reduction in ant species diversity was observed with increasing A. gracilipes densities. Densities ofthis ant were not uniformly high, perhaps due to variation in food availability. Prey such as crabs, ant colonies, and other in- sects were directly observed being attacked, and long-legged ants were observed to feed on honeydew produced by high densities ofaphids, mealybugs, and scale insects on a variety of plants. Interspecific competition was investigated as an additional mechanism for the successful invasion. Long-legged ants found and removed bait faster than the dominant resident ant species, Paratrechina lon- gicornis (Latreille), in forested areas of Nukunonu Island, though needing smaller numbers ofrecruits to achieve this result. This A. gracilipes invasion is of serious concern for the biodiversity of Tokelau and probably many ofthe other Pacific islands where these ants have invaded.",2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Lester & Tavite_2004,2004,"Lester PJ, Tavite A. 2004.

576,26,Anoplolepis gracilipes,Seychelles,Bird Island,"The introduced yellow crazy ant or long-legged ant Anoplolepis gracilipes was first reported in Seychelles in 1969 and now occurs on at least nine islands in the Central Seychelles. We describe the yellow crazy ant’s effects on vegetation and invertebrate communities on one of these, Bird Island; in 2000, Anoplolepis (first reported in 1991) occurred there at densities at least 80 times higher than on other islands in the Central Seychelles. They were associated with high densities of coccid scale insects on foliage, especially of the native tree Pisonia grandis, in some instances causing tree death. Yellow crazy ants on Bird Island also significantly affected invertebrate communities on foliage and on the ground, both in terms of taxonomic composition and the density of specific taxa, apparently causing the local exclusion of some invertebrates..... Dead standing trees were only observed on Bird Island, in areas of yellow crazy ant infestation. In Anoplolepis-free areas of Bird Island, and on Cousin, no dead trees were observed, and most living trees showed high values of foliage cover (in Bird Anoplolepis-free and Cousin sites, only 10 and 22% of trees showed less than complete canopy cover). For live trees, there was a significant difference between canopy cover in Bird Anoplolepis-free and Anoplolepis-infested areas (two-sample t-test for difference in mean foliage cover, Bird (Anoplolepis-infested) vs. Bird (Anoplolepis-free): t 5 4.76; P , 0.001). Mean canopy cover for live trees in Bird Anoplolepis-infested areas was 73%, Bird Anoplolepis-free 95% and Cousin 97%. Within the Bird Anoplolepis-infested area, tree death and foliage loss were more common in trees in taller size classes. Only one tree (of 55) in the ,5 m class was dead, compared with 6 (of 21) in the 5–10 m class and 13 (of 39) in the 10 m1 class (Chi-squared test x 5 14.88, P , 0.01).

We evaluated the pollinator effectiveness of endemic and invasive bees and whether it is affected by the type of resource collected and the presence of ants on flowers. 3. Ants were dominant nectar-consumers that mostly depleted the nectar of visited inflorescences. Accordingly, the visitation frequency, duration, and consequently the pollinator effectiveness of nectar-foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) strongly decreased on ant-visited flowers, whereas pollen-collecting bees remained largely unaffected by ants. Overall, endemic bees (Hylaeus spp.) were ineffective pollinators. 4. The average net effect of ants on pollination of M. polymorpha was neutral, corresponding to a similar fruit set of ant-visited and ant-free inflorescences. 5.

Ant control efforts in 2011 reduced ant densities by more than 97% and resulted in a substantial increase in active burrows (43 in 2011). In invaded areas, burrows appeared to be abandoned by adults prior to egg-laying. Chicks surviving in invaded areas exhibited mild to severe developmental abnormalities, and overall had shorter culmens, tarsi and wingchords, smaller eye diameters, and lower weights than chicks outside invaded areas.

We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion.... When excluding exotic species and considering rainforest sites only (n = 23), we found a significant difference in community composition between sites that belonged to the ‘pristine’ group (Group 1) and sites that were dominated by exotic species in the previous analysis (Groups 2 and 3). This was true at the species (ANOSIM global R = 0.53, P<0.01; Fig. 6), genus (ANOSIM global R = 0.70, P<0.001) and functional group (ANOSIM global R = 0.71, P<0.001) levels, and was independent of the substrate type (ANOSIM P>0.05 in all cases).

A signiWcant negative correla- tion was observed between A. gracilipes and hermit crab abundance. On islands with A. gracilipes, crabs were gener- ally restricted to the periphery of invaded islands. Very few hermit crabs were found in central areas of these islands where A. gracilipes abundances were highest. Ant exclu- sion experiments demonstrated that changes in the abun- dance and distribution of hermit crabs on Tokelau are a result of competition. The ants did not kill the hermit crabs. Rather, when highly abundant, A. gracilipes attacked crabs by spraying acid and drove crabs away from carrion resources. Analysis of naturally occurring N and C isotopes suggests that the ants are eVectively lowering the trophic level of crabs. According to ?15 N values, hermit crabs have a relatively high trophic level on islands where A. gracili- pes have not invaded. In contrast, where these ants have invaded we observed a signiWcant decrease in ?15 N for all crab species. This result concurs with our experiment in suggesting long-term exclusion from carrion resources, driving co-occurring crabs towards a more herbivorous diet.....

We also found that the percentage of plant species with ant visited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species..... Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora.",2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Junker et al_2011,2011,"Junker RR, Daehler CC, Dotterl S, Keller A, Blüthgen N. 2011.

Anoplolepis gracilipes abundance within pitfall traps at the infested site was always significantly greater than the abundance of all other ants combined (Tables 1, 2), being 7.6 and 5.9 times greater than other ant abundance within the infested and uninfested sites respectively in the October sample, and 2.7 and 3.5 times greater respectively in the May sample (Figure 3a)... displacement of other ant species by A. gracilipes is relatively poor and appears to be limited to species of approximately equivalent size or larger.....

These two species excel at both the dis- covery and domination of resources, and could have ‘disassembled’ the native ant fauna. Recent surveys and ecological studies from other Pacific islands show that a very similar set of invasive species to the Yasawa islands are ubiquitous throughout the region.... Species diversity was the lowest on the three islands that were numerically dominated by a single species (low 1/D ratio) (Table 2): Tavewa, which was dominated by Pheidole megacephala; and Naviti and Kuata, which were dominated by Anoplolepis gracilipes. Pairwise comparisons from ANOSIM showed that the overall ant composition of islands were very similar (Table 3). The differences (defined as R> 0.5, Clarke and Warwick, 2005) that existed between islands in the composition of ant species are largely attributable to the frequency of two species, P. megacephala and A. gracilipes. For example, P. megacephala was wide- spread and abundant in the coconut plantations of Tavewa, but were absent from this habitat on Matacawalevu and Nanuya lailai. A. gracilipes was verycommon in forest on Naviti and Kuata, but was recorded only once in forest on Tavewa..... there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that ant assemblages in the Yasawa islands are competitively structured. Both local and regional models generally showed that ant communities in different habitats were randomly assembled. However, there is evidence to show that habitat plays an important role in the assembly of these ant communities.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Ward & Beggs_2007,2007,"Ward D, Beggs J. 2007.

The former main-pollinators of M. polymorpha were birds, which, however, became rare. We evaluated the pollinator effectiveness of endemic and invasive bees and whether it is affected by the type of resource collected and the presence of ants on flowers. 3. Ants were dominant nectar-consumers that mostly depleted the nectar of visited inflorescences. Accordingly, the visitation frequency, duration, and consequently the pollinator effectiveness of nectar-foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) strongly decreased on ant-visited flowers, whereas pollen-collecting bees remained largely unaffected by ants. Overall, endemic bees (Hylaeus spp.) were ineffective pollinators. 4. The average net effect of ants on pollination of M. polymorpha was neutral, corresponding to a similar fruit set of ant-visited and ant-free inflorescences. 5.

IMH remains controversial: few studies show feedback between invaders that amplifies their effects, and none yet demonstrate facilitation of entry and spread of secondary invaders. Our results show that supercolonies of an alien ant, promoted by mutualism with introduced honeydew-secreting scale insects, permitted invasion by an exotic land snail on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean. Modeling of land snail spread over 750 sites across 135 km2 over seven years showed that the probability of land snail invasion was facilitated 253-fold in ant supercolonies but impeded in intact forest where predaceous native land crabs remained abundant. Land snail occurrence at neighboring sites, a measure of propagule pressure, also promoted land snail spread. Site comparisons and experiments revealed that ant super- colonies, by killing land crabs but not land snails, disrupted biotic resistance and provided enemy-free space. Predation pressure on land snails was lower (28.6%), survival 115 times longer, and abundance 20-fold greater in supercolonies than in intact forest. Whole-ecosystem suppression of supercolonies reversed the probability of land snail invasion by allowing recolonization of land crabs; land snails were much less likely (0.79%) to invade sites where supercolonies were suppressed than where they remained intact. Our results provide strong empirical evidence for IMH by demonstrating that mutualism between invaders reconfigures key interactions in the recipient community. This facilitates entry of secondary invaders and elevates propagule pressure, propagating their spread at the whole-ecosystem level.",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Green et al_2011,2011,"Green PT, O’Dowd DJ, Abbott KL, Jeffery M, Retallick K, Mac Nally R. 2011.

Most of the inhabited islands of Vao and Motuhuga on Nukunonu Atoll have been invaded, in addition to several of the uninhabited, forested islands. Despite this ant having been previously recorded from at least one island of Fakaofo and Nukunonu, these appear to be new invasions. Densities ofup to 3,603 A. gracilipes per pitfall trap were caught per 24 hr. A significant reduction in ant species diversity was observed with increasing A. gracilipes densities. Densities ofthis ant were not uniformly high, perhaps due to variation in food availability. Prey such as crabs, ant colonies, and other in- sects were directly observed being attacked, and long-legged ants were observed to feed on honeydew produced by high densities ofaphids, mealybugs, and scale insects on a variety of plants. Interspecific competition was investigated as an additional mechanism for the successful invasion. Long-legged ants found and removed bait faster than the dominant resident ant species, Paratrechina lon- gicornis (Latreille), in forested areas of Nukunonu Island, though needing smaller numbers ofrecruits to achieve this result.

We first examined native ant diversity at nine paired burnt and unburnt sites, with four pairs invaded by Anoplolepis, 5 years after an extensive fire. In the absence of invasion, native epigaeic ants were resilient to fire, but native ant richness and the abundance of Forest Opportunists were markedly lower in invaded burnt sites....

These measures assign different weights to alleles (or species) depending on rarity, with the importance of rare alleles (or species) decreasing as q increases, and together provide a meaningful overview of diversity....

Additionally, A. gracilipes displayed a higher magnitude of responses to nectar than other dominant ants. Mutualisms also had significant impacts on the structure of arthropod communities. These effects were strongest when A. gracilipes dominated local ant assemblages..... ant assemblages differed significantly between sites invaded and uninvaded sites. Anoplolepis gracilipes workers were found more frequently at nectaries than other plant parts, suggesting that nectar resources were important to this species. There was a strong, positive relationship between the dominance of EFN-bearing plants in the community and A. gracilipes abundance on plants, a relationship that co-occurring ants did not display. High abundances of A. gracilipes at sites dominated by EFN-bearing plants were associated with low species richness of native plant-visiting ant species. Anoplolepis gracilipes did not display any significant relationships with the diversity of other non-native ants.....

Over the last 30 or so years, five of the six species have declined to near extinction with the remaining species, C. sadleiri, still reasonably common. A further five species are exotic introductions, the most recent being the Asian Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus) in the 1980s. Here, we document the declines in the native species and discuss possible causal factors in view of the available knowledge....It is hard to believe that predation by introduced species is not a major factor in the native reptile declines on Christmas Island. Four of the native species have contracted to the southwestern tip of the island, which is the most distant area on the island from human settlement (Fig. 1). A large number of known reptile predators have now been introduced to the island, including, the Domestic/Feral Cat (Felis catus), House Mouse (Mus musculus), Giant Centipede (Scolopendra subspinipes), Red Jungle Fowl (Gallus domesticus), Yellow Crazy Ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), Asian Wolf Snake (L. capucinus), Black Rat (Rattus rattus), and Barking or House Gecko (H. frenatus). As far as we know, all of the introduced species have entered the island from the “Settlement” area on the north eastern end of the island (Fig. 1), and it is possible that this suite of introduced predators has acted like a ‘super predator,’ probably operating in conjunction with other processes like inter-specific competition and disturbance.",3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Smith et al_2012,2012,"Smith MJ, Cogger H, Tiernan B, Maple D, Boland C. 2012.

The most common species was Anoplolepis gracilipes, an invasive species present at 70% of all bait sites.... Besides the evident reduction in species richness of forest ants, there was a pronounced shift in community composition towards non-forest taxa. Nine species of oil palm plan- tation ants were never observed in forest leaf litter in an extensive sampling program (Bru¨hl 2001): A. gracilipes, Dolichoderus sp. 1 and 2, Odontoponera denticulata, Mo- nomorium sp. 2, Technomyrmex sp. 2, Oecophylla smaragdina, Paratrechina sp. 2, and Crematogaster sp. 1. The 14 remaining species, which were also recorded in forest leaf litter (Bru¨hl 2001; Bru¨hl et al. 2003), were all rare in the plantations.... The yellow crazy ant, A. gracilipes, was the most abundant species, collected at 70 out of 100 bait sites. It was present in all oil palm plantations and was the only species collected along the transect DFR1. A. gracilipes was also recognised as the dominant arboreal ant in oil palm plan- tations in Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia (Pfeiffer et al. 2008) and in cocoa agroforests in Sulawesi (Bos et al. 2008). The presence of A. gracilipes may in itself be responsible, by means of predation or competitive exclusion, for the very low ant diversity in some of the transects (especially DFR1).

Anoplolepis gracilipes were more likely than O. smaragdina to discover termites on A. lamprocarpa , but the likeli- hood of termite discovery on E. tetrodonta did not vary with ant species. Anoplolepis gracilipes were also more thorough in their attacks of termites, recruited 3.4 – 4 times more workers to termites, and were 3.4 times quicker at discovering termites on A. lamprocarpa than were O. smaragdina . Discovery of termites by other predators did not vary signifi cantly between trees in A. gracilipes and O. smaragdina sites. Herbivory scores did not refl ect the foliage patrolling pattern by the ants. Old A. lamprocarpa leaves and both new and old leaves and branches on E. tetrodonta in A. gracilipes sites had higher chewing herbivory scores than their counterparts in O. smaragdina sites.

Point counts and direct behavioral obser- vations showed that ant invasion altered abundances and behaviors of the bird species we examined: the Island Thrush (Turdus poliocephalus erythropleurus), Emerald Dove (Chalcophaps indica natalis), and Christmas Island White-eye (Zosterops natalis). The thrush, which frequents the forest floor, altered its foraging and reproductive behaviors in ant-invaded forest, where nest-site location changed, and nest success and juvenile counts were lower. Counts of the dove, which forages exclusively on the forest floor, were 9–14 times lower in ant-invaded forest. In contrast, counts and foraging success of the white-eye, a generalist feeder in the understory and canopy, were higher in ant-invaded forest, where mutualism between the ant and honeydew- secreting scale insects increased the abundance of scale-insect prey. These complex outcomes involved the interplay of direct interference by ants and altered resource availability and habitat structure caused indi- rectly by ant invasion.

A signiWcant negative correla- tion was observed between A. gracilipes and hermit crab abundance. On islands with A. gracilipes, crabs were gener- ally restricted to the periphery of invaded islands. Very few hermit crabs were found in central areas of these islands where A. gracilipes abundances were highest. Ant exclu- sion experiments demonstrated that changes in the abun- dance and distribution of hermit crabs on Tokelau are a result of competition. The ants did not kill the hermit crabs. Rather, when highly abundant, A. gracilipes attacked crabs by spraying acid and drove crabs away from carrion resources. Analysis of naturally occurring N and C isotopes suggests that the ants are eVectively lowering the trophic level of crabs. According to ?15 N values, hermit crabs have a relatively high trophic level on islands where A. gracili- pes have not invaded. In contrast, where these ants have invaded we observed a signiWcant decrease in ?15 N for all crab species. This result concurs with our experiment in suggesting long-term exclusion from carrion resources, driving co-occurring crabs towards a more herbivorous diet..... According to ?15 N values, the three hermit crab species on Tokelau have a relatively high trophic level on islands where A. gracilipes had not invaded (Fig. 3). In contrast, on invaded islands we observed a signiWcant decrease in ?15 N for all crab species (PERMANOVA, P < 0.005). We observed no signiWcant diVerences in ?15 N between crab species, nor a signiWcant crab species £ invasion status interaction (P ¸ 0.234).

1186,636,Anoplolepis gracilipes,,,,,,,,,"Invasive species displace native species and potentially alter the structure and function of ecological communities. In this study, we compared the generic composition of intact and invaded ant communities from 12 published studies and found that invasive ant species alter the phylogenetic structure of native ant communities. Intact ant communities were phylogenetically evenly dispersed, suggesting that competition structures communities. However, in the presence of an invasive ant species, these same communities were phylo- genetically clustered. Phylogenetic clustering in invaded communities suggests that invasive species may act as strong environmental filters and prune the phylogenetic tree of native species in a nonrandom manner, such that only a few closely related taxa can persist in the face of a biological invasion. Taxa that were displaced by invasive ant species were evenly dispersed in the phylogeny, suggesting that diversity losses from invasive ant species are not clustered in particular lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that there is strong phylogenetic structuring in intact native ant communities, but the spread of invasive species disassembles those communities above and beyond the effect of simple reductions in diversity..... We compiled data on the composition of ant communities by searching Web of Science and Google Scholar using the key words ants, invasive, invasion, community, richness, diversity, and structure on 30 November 2007.

651,101,Brachymyrmex obscurior,New Caledonia,New Caledonia,,,,,,,"We conducted a systematic baiting survey of 56 sites representing the main New Caledonian habitat types: rainforest on ultramafic soils (15 sites), rainforest on volcano-sedimentary soils (13), maquis shrubland (15), Melaleuca-dominated savannas (11) and Acacia spirorbis thickets (2). We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion.... When excluding exotic species and considering rainforest sites only (n = 23), we found a significant difference in community composition between sites that belonged to the ‘pristine’ group (Group 1) and sites that were dominated by exotic species in the previous analysis (Groups 2 and 3). This was true at the species (ANOSIM global R = 0.53, P<0.01; Fig. 6), genus (ANOSIM global R = 0.70, P<0.001) and functional group (ANOSIM global R = 0.71, P<0.001) levels, and was independent of the substrate type (ANOSIM P>0.05 in all cases). The RELATE procedure revealed no significant relationship between the similarity matrices of ant community composition and of habitat variables (? = 0.07; P = 0.26). SIMPER revealed that Generalized Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were the functional groups contributing most (34 and 30% respectively) to the dissimilarity (Table 3).",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,"Dataset overlapping with Berman et al_2013a, different analysis… ",Berman et al_2013b,2013,"Berman M, Andersen AN, Hély C, Gaucherel C. 2013.

1117,567,Brachymyrmex obscurior,Bahamas,central Exumas,,,,,,,"Numerous studies have demonstrated the existence of intra- and interspecific competition among ants, but few have investigated direct competitive interactions between ants and other taxa. In this paper, I present the first evidence of direct competitive interactions between ants and crabs. Evidence of competition for food between ants and the land hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst), was derived from observations and experiments in an archipelago of small islands in the central Exumas, Bahamas. Correlational evidence of competition for food based on occurrences at baits was found between ants and hermit crabs in multiple years. Observations at baits over time revealed species turnover occurred due to aggressive interactions. C. clypeatus discovered food items rapidly, but lost control of food over time, particularly to the ant Brachymyrmex obscurior Forel, which took longer to find food items but recruited large numbers of workers that drove off hermit crabs. A second ant species, Dorymyrmex pyramicus Roger, discovered baits quickly but did not recruit to baits in large numbers, and was not a superior competitor to either C. clypeatus or B. obscurior. Competition between ants and land hermit crabs was not intense enough to cause complementary distributions, and mechanisms of coexistence apparently include temporal variation in foraging activity and complementary foraging strategies when ants and crabs are active at the same time. Because of the widespread distributions and generalist scavenger diets of many ants and crabs, such competitive interactions are likely to be a common facet of many tropical and subtropical insular and coastal communities.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Morrison_2002b,2002,Morrison LW. 2002.

These results are similar to results from Gue´nard and Dunn (2010), who reported that species of both Formica and Camponotus were either more common or unaffected by the presence of P. chinensis.... One possible explanation for the dramatic drop in A. rudis abundance could be that P. chinensis is preferentially preying upon A. rudis. Pachycondyla chinensis has been found to kill A. rudis workers in direct interactions in laboratory experiments (Bednar 2010).

Both species consisted of polymorphic workers, and conducted mass raiding upon turtle nests. As a result of the observation of foraging behavior of ant species in 2004 by using food traps, D. laevigatus (a subterranean species) shared the bait with some terrestrial ant species in the early stage of the experiment except P. affinis. However, P. affinis was a terrestrial species and established satellite nests in the traps to occupy the bait. Traps placed in the habitat of Anoplolepis gracilipes were immediately occupied by them during whole experimental period and other terrestrial ant species were not found in the traps. Anoplolepis gracilipes seemed to be the strongest competitor among the terrestrial ant species in Chagar Hutang, which might result in reduction of the population number of P. affinis with the existence of A. gracilipes. As a result, D. laevigatus became a major predator upon turtle nests, which might have caused the high rate of predation incidences in this area in 2004.

In this paper, I present the first evidence of direct competitive interactions between ants and crabs. Evidence of competition for food between ants and the land hermit crab, Coenobita clypeatus (Herbst), was derived from observations and experiments in an archipelago of small islands in the central Exumas, Bahamas. Correlational evidence of competition for food based on occurrences at baits was found between ants and hermit crabs in multiple years. Observations at baits over time revealed species turnover occurred due to aggressive interactions. C. clypeatus discovered food items rapidly, but lost control of food over time, particularly to the ant Brachymyrmex obscurior Forel, which took longer to find food items but recruited large numbers of workers that drove off hermit crabs. A second ant species, Dorymyrmex pyramicus Roger, discovered baits quickly but did not recruit to baits in large numbers, and was not a superior competitor to either C. clypeatus or B. obscurior. Competition between ants and land hermit crabs was not intense enough to cause complementary distributions, and mechanisms of coexistence apparently include temporal variation in foraging activity and complementary foraging strategies when ants and crabs are active at the same time. Because of the widespread distributions and generalist scavenger diets of many ants and crabs, such competitive interactions are likely to be a common facet of many tropical and subtropical insular and coastal communities.",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Morrison_2002b,2002,Morrison LW. 2002.

This effect may be not limited to the ant nest and may occur where ants develop a higher activity, i.e. close to the tree where ants collect honeydew. The aim of this study was to compare decomposition of holm oak litter beneath holm oaks visited by the invasive ant Lasius neglectus or by native ants and depending on the litter quality that each tree type produce. At two sites (UAB and Seva) we choose twelve holm oaks visited by Lasius neglectus or by native ants. We performed a reciprocal litter transfer decomposition experiment. Four litterbags (15x15cm, 1.5mm mesh size) filled with 8g of holm oak litter from trees visited by the invasive or by native ants (litter types) were buried (5cm depth) beneath each tree type. In total we buried 384 litterbags (12 trees X 4 litterbags x 2 litter type x 2 tree type x 2 sites). At 3 months intervals, twelve litterbags per treatment were unburied. Decomposition experiment was performed along one year. Initial and final litter quality was analyzed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. At Seva, initial litter quality from holm oaks visited by the invasive ant was the lowest litter quality. Remaining mass and nitrogen immobilization was greater at Seva for litter from holm oaks visited by the invasive ant compared to both litter types from UAB. There were no differences of mass loss between holm oaks visited by any ant species. In general, nitrogen immobilized more beneath holm oaks visited by the invasive ant.

Attacks of L. neglectus were performed fastest and most frequent against L. grandis, and also the highest antennation frequencies were observed in encounters between these two species. This could be due to the largest difference in body size, or due to a greater overlap in ecological niche between L. neglectus and L. grandis com- pared to the other two native species....In approximately 50 % of the aggressive interactions, the ant starting the attack could be determined (52 % (24 / 45) of the aggressive interactions between L. neglectus and L. grandis, 55 % (21 / 38) of the aggressive encounters with L. emarginatus and 39 % (15 / 38) of the fights with L. cinereus). Lasius neglectus started the attacks in the majority of the cases: in 79 % (19 / 24) of the fights against L. grandis, in 76 % (16 / 21) against L. emarginatus, and in 93 % (14 / 15) against L. cinereus.

1038,488,Lasius neglectus,Spain,Barcelona,"We have found that two Lasius ant species, one native and the other invasive, may change the com- position of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of the holm oak (Quercus ilex) blend when they tend the aphid Lachnus roboris. The aphid regulation of its feed- ing and honeydew production accord- ing to the ant demands was proposed as a plausible mechanism that triggers changes in VOCs. Additionally, we now report here that aphid feeding, which is located most of the time on acorns cap or petiole, significantly increased the relative content of linolenic acid in acorns from holm oak colonized by the invasive ant. This acid is involved in the response of plants to insect herbivory as a precursor or jasmonic acid. No effect was found on acorn production, germination or seedlings quality.... We conclude that ants, through their mutualism with tended aphids, may promote considerable changes of holm oaks VOCs emission and acorn quality. However, there was no effect on seedling quality in spite of the decrease of linole- nic acid content of acorns from holm oaks where aphids were tended by the invasive ant. These results indicate that the physio- logical response of acorns to aphid feeding tended by invasive or local ants does not necessary imply a low quality of seedlings as we previously expected.",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Paris et al_2011,2011,"Paris CI, Llusia J, Peñuelas J. 2011.

1039,489,Lasius neglectus,Spain,Barcelona,"In this study, we compared if acorn production was modified when the aphids of holm oaks were tended by the invasive ant Lasius neglectus or by the native ant Lasius grandis. Both ant species have similar ecological traits but the invasive ant is polygynic and more abundant compared with the native ant. We initially hypothesized that the invasive ant Lasius neglectus would increase aphid abundance in holm oaks, collecting in this way more honeydew as compared with the effect of the native ant Lasius grandis. As a consequence, we expected that acorn production would decrease when aphids were tended by the invasive ant. Over a 6 months period the invasive ant Lasius neglectus collected 2.09 kg of honeydew per tree meanwhile the native ant collected 0.82 kg. The main tended aphid, Lachnus roboris, fed on the petiole or cap acorns since they began their development. Lachnus roboris abundance was not affected by specific ant identity. The percentage of untended colonies was significantly lower at holm trees occupied by the invasive ant. Honeydew production tended to increase when Lasius neglectus tended Lachnus roboris. The native ant workers carried significantly more items (insects, part of insects and unidentified items) than the invasive ant. Both ant species preyed on the same insects that were Psocoptera and the aphid, Hoplocallis picta. Acorn production, seedling emergency or seedling quality did not differ between trees occupied by the invasive or the native ant. We conclude that the higher abundance of the invasive ant Lasius neglectus allowed this ant to tend more Lachnus roboris colonies achieving in this way a higher honeydew collection. The increase of aphid abundance and honeydew production when aphids were tended by the invasive ant did not translate in a decrease of acorn production (quantity and quality).",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Paris_2007,2007,Paris CI. 2007.

However, at a site invaded by Argentine ants, we monitored over 400 nests of a ground- nesting species, the Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis), and found that less than 2 % of nests failed as a result of Argentine ant predation/infestation.

However, inva- sive ants with the capability of overwhelming prey though stinging (specifi cally the red-imported fi re ant, Solenopsis invicta), may have a higher impact on avian nesting success....

565,15,Linepithema humile,United States,California,,,,"Biological invasions can have severe direct and indirect impacts on natural communities and are one of the leading reasons behind the loss of biodiversity. We inves- tigated the indirect effects of Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) invasions on coastal horned lizards (Phrynosoma coronatum) through an examination of prey selection in the field and laboratory. In non-invaded areas, coastal horned lizard diet consists predominately of ants (?94% by prey item in three reserves examined), particularly harvester ants in the genera Pogonomyrmex and Messor. In invaded areas, most native ants were displaced, and remaining horned lizards incorporated more non-ant arthropods and smaller ants into their diet. In addition, Argentine ants were never detected in horned lizard fecal pellets, sug- gesting that they are not a suitable replacement food source for the native species they are displacing. Analysis of prey selection in uninvaded areas reveals that ant species con- sumption by adult lizards is correlated with ant body size rather than ant abundance, foraging behavior, or defensive method. Differences in diet between adult and juvenile lizards suggest that a diversity of ant species is necessary to support both age classes. Laboratory exper- iments, consisting of paired presentations of four native ant species and the Argentine ant, confirmed patterns found in the field. Both adult and juvenile horned lizards preferred native ants to Argentine ants. Patterns of preference suggest that, in addition to L. humile’s small size, other factors may contribute to the horned lizard’s aversion to this species. Populations of coastal horned lizards have undergone severe declines in recent years.
While habitat loss has been the primary concern, the invasion of Argentine ants into their remaining suitable habitat needs to be monitored. Reserves need to be managed to prevent the penetration of Argentine ants in order to minimize their direct and indirect effects on natural communities..... While the small size of Argentine ants clearly contributes to their unsuitability as a replace- ment food source for the native ants they are displacing, two lines of evidence suggest they may be unpalatable or avoided for other reasons as well.... Other fac- tors such as unpalatability due to novel defensive chemical compounds also may deter horned lizards.... capable of detoxifying poisons of ants with which they share an evolutionary history.",2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Suarez et al_2000,2000,"Suarez A V., Richmond JQ, Case TJ. 2000.

Seeds dispersed in invaded sites were: (a) less likely to be transported; (b) potentially distributed over a smaller spatial area, and (c) less likely to be placed at soil depths favourable for germination and establishment compared to those dispersed in non-invaded sites. These results reveal that ant-mediated seed dispersal services are signifi- cantly reduced by an invasive species at multiple stages in the dispersal process.

First, we performed laboratory assays to assess the foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) in response to live Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) or to a subset of ant chemical cues. We found that bees were deterred by the presence of live ants as well as the combination of olfactory and gustatory ant chemical cues. Next, we characterized specific ant-bee interactions and behavioral transitions at shared nectar resources. We found that two-thirds of bee behaviors did not involve feeding, and, of those, the majority of them were aggressive interactions with ants. Similarly, 70% of behavioral transitions did not involve feeding, of which 82.3% were transitions among aggressive behaviors. Consistent with predictions of interference competition, the number of ants at a shared resource decreased the probability of a bee feeding and increased the likelihood of a bee being bitten. Similarly, getting bitten by an ant decreased the probability that a bee would subsequently feed.... foragers that came into contact with ants and were nonaggressive were less successful at resource acquisition, while the foragers exhibiting aggression toward ants were more successful",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Miner_2018,2018,Miner MC. 2018.

625,75,Linepithema humile,South Africa,Western Cape Province,"The loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services are major threats posed by the spread of alien invasive species. Invasive ants are frequently associated with declines in the diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods but also may affect plants through their attraction to floral nectar and tending of hemipterans. Protea nitida is a tree native to the South African fynbos that hosts a native membracid, Beaufortiana sp., which is tended by ants. Here I compare Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) to native ants in their attraction to P. nitida inflorescences in the presence and absence of the membracid, and their effects on other floral arthropod visitors, seed set, and ovule pr?dation. Argentine ant discovery of inflorescences increased at least 13-fold when membracids were present on the branch, whereas native ant discovery of inflorescences was only doubled by membracid presence at one site in one study year and was unaffected in the other three site-years. Excluding Argentine ants from inflorescences resulted in an increase in several arthropod taxa and potential pollinators; native ant exclusion had no positive effects. Thus the mutualism between Argentine ants and the membracid is facilitating pollinator deterrence by the ants. Though Argentine ants were not associated with a decline in P. nitida seed set or ovule predation, declines in generalist insect pollinators may have ramifications for the 83% of fynbos plants that are insect pollinated. Pitfall traps showed that Argentine ants were not more abundant than native ants in non-invaded sites. Focusing only on abundance on the ground and displacement of ground dwelling arthropod fauna may lead to an underestimate of the effects of invasive ants on their adopted communities.",0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,Lach_2007a,2007,Lach L. 2007.

627,77,Linepithema humile,Spain,Serra Llonga,"The alteration of the seed dispersal process due to the Argentine ant invasion and its consequences on emergence, recruitment, distribution, and survival of seedlings of Euphorbia characias were analyzed. The study was carried out in two zones of Mediterranean cork-oak secondary forest, one invaded by L. humile and the other non- invaded. Two cohorts of E. characias seedlings (those emerged in 2001 and those emerged in 2002) were studied in three study plots in each zone. The level of seed loss due to lack of viability, parasitizing, and vertebrate predation did not differ between the two zones. The mean seed sowing depth was lower in the invaded zone (13.5 mm) than in the non-invaded zone (22.4 mm). This depth difference implies a longer time needed for seedlings to emerge in the non-invaded zone but not a different emergence percent under laboratory conditions. In the field study plots seedling recruitment did not differ between the two zones, probably due to the trade-off between the differences in the initial number of seeds released (higher in the non-invaded zone) and the different emergence proportions (higher in the invaded zone). As for the spatial characteristics of emerged seedlings, no differences in the mean seedling distance to the nearest inflorescence or to the nearest seedling or in the pattern of seedling distribution were found between zones. Seedling survival was assessed once a month until they had reached maturity or until all of them had died. The median seedling survival time was similar between the invaded and the non-invaded zones. Survival curves also did not differ between zones. The present study suggests a functional equivalence of the Argentine ant after the replacement of the native ant species. Despite the initial differences found, the final reproductive success of E. characias was not altered after the invasion. However, the case of E. characias seems unlikely to be the rule, and the seed dynamics of other species may be altered, i.e. increased or decreased, and thus positively or negatively affected by the invasion",0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,REVIEWED (Rodriguez_Cabal et al_2009) Argentine ant disruption of seed-disperasal mutualism,Oliveras et al_2005,2005,"Oliveras J, Bas JM, Casellas D, Gómez C. 2005.

628,78,Linepithema humile,Portugal,Lisbon,,,,"Interactions occurring between Orthotomicus erosus, an economically important pine bark beetle in Portugal, and the aggressive Argentine ant Linepithema humile were investigated. Tri-trophic ‘‘experimental enclosures’’ consisting of Pinus pinaster logs, O. erosus adults and L. humile workers were set up in the field and in the laboratory. Interactions between ants and sco- lytids were observed and quantified in terms of the bark beetle’s success in colonizing the logs. The presence of L. humile did not influence the ability of O. erosus to colonize the logs, apparently due to the difficulties met by the ants in handling the bark beetles and to their inability to injure them. Thus, although abundant in many pine stands in Portugal and in spite of its aggressiveness, L. humile does not seem to affect popu- lations of O. erosus.... In field experiments, apparently more beetles emerged from logs subjected to ant foraging (a=233) than from those kept ant-free (a=7). In terms of productivity per unit of phloem surface, an average of 15 beetles emerged per m2 in ant-free EE, whereas 741 emerged per m2 from EE with ants. These results might be partly explained by the different bark thickness of the logs used in both treatments: a thinner bark, such as that of logs EF3 and EF4, is indeed more suitable for the penetration of O. erosus (e.g. Paiva et al. 1988) than thicker ones, i.e. logs F1 and F2. Nevertheless, O. erosus is able to colo- nize pine trunks with a bark thickness of up to 1 cm (Markalas 1997). In the laboratory, a higher number of beetles emerged from ant-free logs (a=71), than from those subjected to ant foraging (a=45), respectively, an average of 273 and 191 adults per m2 of phloem. All logs had similar bark thickness, and although results were less variable than in the field experiments, there is no clear trend regarding the production of scolytids in relation to ant presence. Since no apparent effect from a potential interaction between L. humile and O. erosus could be inferred, we postulate that these results reflect the absence of signif- icant interactions.",0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,Henin & Paiva_2004,2004,"Henin JM, Paiva MR. 2004.

640,90,Linepithema humile,United States,California/San Diego,,,,"Invasive ants often displace native ants, and pub- lished studies that focus on these interactions usually empha- size interspecifi c competition for food resources as a key mechanism responsible for the demise of native ants. Al- though less well documented, nest raiding by invasive ants may also contribute to the extirpation of native ants. In coastal southern California, for example, invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) commonly raid colonies of the harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex subnitidus. On a seasonal ba- sis the frequency and intensity of raids vary, but raids occur only when abiotic conditions are suitable for both species. In the short term these organized attacks cause harvester ants to cease foraging and to plug their nest entrances. In unstaged, one-on-one interactions between P. subnitidus and L. humile workers, Argentine ants behaved aggressively in over two thirds of all pair-wise interactions, despite the much larger size of P. subnitidus. The short-term introduction of experi- mental Argentine ant colonies outside of P. subnitidus nest entrances stimulated behaviors similar to those observed in raids: P. subnitidus decreased its foraging activity and in- creased the number of nest entrance workers (many of which labored to plug their nest entrances). Raids are not likely to be the result of competition for food. As expected, P. sub- nitidus foraged primarily on plant material (85 % of food items obtained from returning foragers), but also collected some dead insects (7 % of food items). In buffet-style choice tests in which we offered Argentine ants food items obtained from P. subnitidus, L. humile only showed interest in dead insects. In other feeding trials L. humile consistently moved harvester ant brood into their nests (where they were pre- sumably consumed) but showed little interest in freshly dead workers. The raiding behavior described here obscures the distinction between interspecifi c competition and predation, and may well play an important role in the displacement of native ants, especially those that are ecologically dissimilar to L. humile with respect to diet....... Argentine ant raids on P. subnitidus colonies occurred often, but their frequency varied from month-to-month, reaching a maximum during the survey period in May (Fig. 1). All 25 of the monitored P. subnitidus colonies interacted with Argen- tine ants during the survey period with nearly half (12/25) experiencing heavy or severe raids at some point.

The composition of inverte- brates (Order-level, ant and beetle species) was different between invaded and uninvaded sites, with fewer ants, isopods, amphipods, and fungus-feeding beetles at the invaded sites, whereas Collembola were more abundant at the invaded sites. There were significant differences in soil chemistry, including higher carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass at uninvaded sites. Several litter components were significantly different for Macropiper excelsum. The fibre content of litter was higher, and key nutrients (e.g. nitrogen) were lower, at invaded sites, indicating less breakdown of litter at invaded sites. A greater knowledge of the history of invasion at a site would clarify variation in the impacts of Argentine ants, but their persistence in the ground litter layer may have long-term implications for soil and plant health in native ecosystems.....  Our findings of significantly lower soil microbial concentrations and slower decomposition (litter bag technique and litter chemistry) in the invaded sites (cf. similar uninvaded sites) provide the first indication of an association between Argentine ants and decomposition and soil health.

Our results show that Argentine ants interact with arboreal foliage arthropods in a different manner than the native ants they displace do. The invasive ant impacted the arthropod community by reducing order diversity and ant species richness and by causing extirpation of most native ant species. Arthropod availability for foliage gleaners’ nestlings diminished in invaded cork oaks, mainly responding to the abundance and biomass depletion of caterpillars. Results suggest that the reproduction of canopy- foraging foliage-gleaning species that mostly rely on caterpillars to feed their young could be compromised by the Argentine ant invasion.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Estany-Tigerstrom et al_2010,2010,"Estany-Tigerström D, Bas JM, Pons P. 2010.

674,124,Linepithema humile,Spain,Catalonia,,,,,,,,,,"Cork oak forests invaded by the Argentine ant Linepithema humile have a lower abundance and biomass of arthropod prey for birds than uninvaded forests. We studied whether the biomass of breeding insectivorous birds was also lower in invaded areas. We explored this and other possible effects of the ant invasion on the bird com- munity by censusing birds in transects located in four invaded and four uninvaded forest sites in Catalonia (NE Spain) for 3 years. Redundancy analysis showed only slight dif- ferences in the community composition between forests. Two insectivorous species, Luscinia megarhynchos and Fringilla coelebs, tended to be less abundant in invaded areas although two others, Phylloscopus bonelli and Sylvia melanocephala, showed the opposite trend. Overall, the differences in prey biomass between invaded and uninvaded areas did not entail a biomass shift in the guild of insectivorous birds, regardless of whether they were shrub or canopy foragers. The main role of the habitat structure in determining bird densities and food resources being non-limiting in the studied forests are two possible non- exclusive explanations for this inconsistency. At today’s levels, the Argentine ant invasion does not appear to have greatly determined the insectivorous bird assemblage of the forests evaluated.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Pons et al_2010,2010,"Pons P, Bas JM, Estany-Tigerström D. 2010.

However, small hypogeic ants, including Solenopsis sp. (Myrmicinae) and Heteroponera imbellis (Heteroponerinae), were little affected. Linepithema humile had no detectable effect upon the abundance and richness of other litter invertebrates. However, invertebrate group composition differed significantly between invaded and uninvaded sites, owing to the varied response of several influential groups (e.g. Collembola and Acarina). Floristics, habitat structure and measured environmental factors did not differ significantly between sites either invaded or uninvaded by Argentine ants, supporting the contention that differences in native ant abundance and species composition are related to invasion.",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,REVIEWED (Rodriguez_Cabal et al_2009) Argentine ant disruption of seed-disperasal mutualism,Rowles & O'Dowd_2009a,2009,"Rowles AD, O’Dowd DJ. 2009.

Moreover, in 77% of EFN?open and 69% of EFN?covered inflorescences in which both species were present during an observation, Camponotus spp. were not subsequently observed in the same inflorescence. Cr. peringueyi was never found in inflorescences that were visited by Argentine ants and discovered fewer inflorescences than Camponotus spp. and Argentine ants (Table 1). Other native ants such as Plagiolepis sp., Anoplolepis steingroeveri (Forel), and Lepisiota capensis (Mayr) were only rarely observed in inflorescences.

For- agers from laboratory colonies placed in the field consistently and rapidly displaced the tyrant ant Iridomyrmex bicknelli, the big- headed ant Pheidole sp. 2, and the pony ant Rhytidoponera victoriae from baits. Numerical and behavioural dominance enabled Argentine ants to displace these ants in just 20 min; the abundance of native species at baits declined 3.5–24 fold in direct relation to the rapid increase in L. humile. Most precipitous was the decline of I. bicknelli,eventhoughspecies in this typically dominant genus have been hypothesized to limit invasion of L. humile in Australia. Interspecific aggression contributed strongly to the competitive success of Argen- tine ants at baits. Fighting occurred in 50–75% of all observed interactions between Argentine and native ants. This study indicates that Argentine ants recruit rapidly, numerically dominate, and aggressively displace from baits a range of Australian native ant species from different subfamilies and functional groups.

682,132,Linepithema humile,Portugal,Madeira,,,,,,,"1. The earliest exotic records for two notorious invasive ants, the big-headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ) and the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ), both come from the Atlantic islands of Madeira, where the two species underwent population explosions in the 1850s and 1890s respectively. Researchers have long assumed that these invaders spread across all of Madeira and exterminated most or all native ants, despite no research actually documenting such impact. 2. Re-examination of first-hand nineteenth century accounts suggest that P. megacephala and L. humile may never have spread beyond coastal lowland areas, representing < 10% of Madeira’s land area. In 2002, native ants dominated most of Madeira’s land area respectively. Madeira; P. megacephala and L. humile were restricted to ? 0.3% and ? 6% of 3. Of the 10 native ant species known from Madeira, only one ( Temnothorax wollastoni ) was not present in 1999 – 2002 surveys. Although exotic ants may have exterminated T. wollastoni , it seems likely that this species still survives. 4. Thus, even after 150 or more years of residence, P. megacephala and L. humile have come to occupy only a small part of Madeira, and appear to have had little impact. 5. Most of Madeira may be too cool for P. megacephala and perhaps too moist for L. humile to dominate. Also, Madeira’s vast natural areas may generally lack weedy vegetation that can support high densities of plant-feeding Hemiptera critical for the ecological dominance of invasive ants. Finally, a dominant native ant, Lasius grandis , inhabiting ? 84% of Madeira, may actively exclude P. megacephala and L. humile .",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Wetterer et al_2006,2006,"Wetterer JK, Espadaler X, Wetterer AL, Aguin-Pombo D, Franquinho-Aguiar AM. 2006.

Iridomyrmex differed from native ants in being slower to discover the seeds (morphologically achenes) of ant-dispersed Mimetes cucullatus (Proteaceae), in moving them shorter distances, and in failing to store them in nests below the soil. Seeds left on the soil surface were eaten by vertebrate and invertebrate predators. To study seedling emergence, seed depots were established and then the area was burned. Emergence was 35.3% in sites not infested by Iridomyrmex and 0.7% in infested sites. Seedlings in naturally occurring stands of M. cucullatus burnt in the same fire were widely distributed in noninfested sites, but were fewer and were confined within the canopy radius in infested sites.

In both surveys, total of 25 species was recorded: 23 species in 1999 and 20 species in 2012.... The differences between the two datasets are due to the inclusion of two previously unobserved species, Temnothorax koreanus (Teranishi) and Hypoponera nubatama Terayama & Hashimoto, and the apparent disappearance of five previously observed species, Nylanderia flavipes (F.

693,143,Linepithema humile,United States,California,,,,,,,"Invasive species pose serious threats to community structure and ecosystem function worldwide. The impacts of invasive species can be more pervasive than simple reduction of species numbers. By using 7 years of data in a biological preserve in northern California, we documented the disassembly of native ant communities during an invasion by the Argentine ant. In sites without the Argentine ant, native ant communities exhibit significant species segrega- tion, consistent with competitive dynamics. In sites with the Argentine ant, native ant communities appear random or weakly aggregated in species co-occurrence. Comparisons of the same sites before and after invasion indicate that the shift from a structured to a random community is rapid and occurs within a year of invasion. Our results show that invasive species not only reduce biodiversity but rapidly disassemble communities and, as a result, alter community organization among the species that persist..... There was evidence for nonrandom co-occurrence patterns (segregation) of native species within intact regions but not within invaded regions. For the set of intact matrices, there was significantly less species co-occurrence than expected by chance (single sample t test, t ? 6.087, df ? 11, P ? 0.001), and the null hypothesis was rejected on all sampling dates except the May and September 2000 surveys. For the set of invaded matrices, there was significantly more co-occurrence than expected by chance (single sample t test, t ??2.877, df ? 11, P ? 0.015), with statistically significant aggregation patterns occurring in May 1997, May 1998, May 2000, and September 2000. There were also consistent differences in the co-occurrence patterns of intact and invaded regions sampled at the same time period (single sample t test, t ? 2.285, df ? 11, P ? 0.043). Differences in the pattern were statistically significant on sam- pling dates of September 1995, September 1996, September 1997, and May 1999. On all sampling dates, the co-occurrence pattern always tended more toward species segregation in the intact sample plots and species aggregation in the invaded sample plots (Fig. 1). Co-occurrence patterns change once L. humile invades. For the set of preinvasion matrices, there was significantly less species co-occurrence than expected by chance (single sample t test, t ? 4.394, df ? 11, P ? 0.003), and the null hypothesis was rejected for four of the eight matrices (September 1996, May 1997, September 1997, and May 1999).

Native ant assemblages along the chronosequence exhibited reduced native ant richness and altered species composition (compared to uninvaded control sites), but the magnitude of these impacts was independent of time since invasion. These results are corroborated by additional temporal comparisons of native ant assemblages at ripar- ian sites sampled 20–30 yr ago. Our findings together illustrate that the impacts of invasions can per- sist undiminished over at least a 30-yr time frame and remain evident at regional scales.

Despite having relatively low abundance in pitfall traps, Argentine ants visited inflorescences more frequently and in higher abundance than the most frequently observed native ants, Camponotus spp., though neither native nor Argentine ant floral foraging was influenced by the EFNs. Non?metric multidimensional scaling revealed significant dissimilarity in arthropod communities on inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to inflorescences with native or no ants, with Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Arachnida, Orthoptera, and Blattaria all being underrepresented in inflorescences with Argentine ants compared to ant?excluded inflorescences. Native honeybees (Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz) spent 75% less time foraging on inflorescences with Argentine ants than on inflorescences without ants. Neither Argentine ant nor native ant visits to inflorescences had a detectable effect on seed set of Le. conocarpodendron. However, a pollen supplementation experiment revealed that like many other proteas, Le. conocarpodendron is not pollen?limited. Flower predation was negatively associated with increased ant visit frequency to the inflorescences, but did not differ among inflorescences visited by native and Argentine ants.

702,152,Linepithema humile,South Africa,Western Cape Province,,,,,,,,,,"The loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services are major threats posed by the spread of alien invasive species. Invasive ants are frequently associated with declines in the diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods but also may affect plants through their attraction to floral nectar and tending of hemipterans. Protea nitida is a tree native to the South African fynbos that hosts a native membracid, Beaufortiana sp., which is tended by ants. Here I compare Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) to native ants in their attraction to P. nitida inflorescences in the presence and absence of the membracid, and their effects on other floral arthropod visitors, seed set, and ovule pr?dation. Argentine ant discovery of inflorescences increased at least 13-fold when membracids were present on the branch, whereas native ant discovery of inflorescences was only doubled by membracid presence at one site in one study year and was unaffected in the other three site-years. Excluding Argentine ants from inflorescences resulted in an increase in several arthropod taxa and potential pollinators; native ant exclusion had no positive effects. Thus the mutualism between Argentine ants and the membracid is facilitating pollinator deterrence by the ants. Though Argentine ants were not associated with a decline in P. nitida seed set or ovule pr?dation, declines in generalist insect pollinators may have ramifications for the 83% of fynbos plants that are insect pollinated. Pitfall traps showed that Argentine ants were not more abundant than native ants in non-invaded sites.

Of four natural habitats surveyed (valley riparian woodland, foothill riparian woodland, blue oak-digger pine woodland, and chaparral), at 46 sites in Yolo and Solano counties, only valley riparian woodland was found to have been colonized by I. humilis. Riparian woodland sites occupied by I. humilis have permanent sources of water and tend to be environmentally degraded. Populations of I. humilis are common but patchily distributed along four principal riparian systems in Yolo and Solano counties (Ulatis Creek, Putah Creek, Cache Creek, and the Sacramento River). Observations indicate that patches of semidisturbed riparian woodland provide refuges from which populations of I. humilis may invade adjacent agricultural land, and vice versa. The species richness of native ants is markedly reduced at riparian woodland sites occupied by I. humilis. Among the common native ants, epigaeic (aboveground foraging) species are more susceptible to displacement by I. humilis than are hypogaeic species.

We examined the diversity and composition of invertebrate and microorganisms communities, and differences in soil and litter components. The composition of inverte- brates (Order-level, ant and beetle species) was different between invaded and uninvaded sites, with fewer ants, isopods, amphipods, and fungus-feeding beetles at the invaded sites, whereas Collembola were more abundant at the invaded sites. There were significant differences in soil chemistry, including higher carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass at uninvaded sites. Several litter components were significantly different for Macropiper excelsum. The fibre content of litter was higher, and key nutrients (e.g. nitrogen) were lower, at invaded sites, indicating less breakdown of litter at invaded sites. A greater knowledge of the history of invasion at a site would clarify variation in the impacts of Argentine ants, but their persistence in the ground litter layer may have long-term implications for soil and plant health in native ecosystems..... There were strong differences between the composition of the ant fauna of invaded and uninvaded sites for both litter and pitfall sampling at Waikowhai (litter, R = 0.857; pitfall, R = 0.948), but only for pitfall sampling at the North Shore site (litter, R = 0.220; pitfall, R = 0.991), but not litter on the North Shore (R = 0.220).

The invasive ant impacted the arthropod community by reducing order diversity and ant species richness and by causing extirpation of most native ant species. Arthropod availability for foliage gleaners’ nestlings diminished in invaded cork oaks, mainly responding to the abundance and biomass depletion of caterpillars. Results suggest that the reproduction of canopy- foraging foliage-gleaning species that mostly rely on caterpillars to feed their young could be compromised by the Argentine ant invasion.....

However, invertebrate group composition differed significantly between invaded and uninvaded sites, owing to the varied response of several influential groups (e.g. Collembola and Acarina). Floristics, habitat structure and measured environmental factors did not differ significantly between sites either invaded or uninvaded by Argentine ants, supporting the contention that differences in native ant abundance and species composition are related to invasion.",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,REVIEWED (Rodriguez_Cabal et al_2009) Argentine ant disruption of seed-disperasal mutualism,Rowles & O'Dowd_2009b,2009,"Rowles AD, O’Dowd DJ. 2009.

Several groups of invertebrates were entirely absent from, or extremely rare in, areas invaded by L. humile . There were no muscid flies (Diptera: Muscidae), very few phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae), and no springtails (Collembola), cynipid wasps (Hymenoptera), ticks (Aca- rina: Ixodidae), or mites (Acarina: Areneae). In areas in- vaded by L. humile , sowbugs (Crustacea: Isopoda: Arma- dillidiidae) made up 66% of the total number of non-ant individuals caught in pitfall traps, whereas none were found in areas without L. humile . Camel crickets (Or- thoptera: Gryllacrididae) and common black ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were both more com- mon in areas invaded by L. humile (Table 1).... The trophic structure of invertebrate communities was influenced by the Argentine ant invasion. When grouped by diet, the invertebrate communities sampled from invaded areas contained a larger fraction of scaven- gers (saprophages and mycophages) than did non- invaded areas (Fig. 1, p ? 0.001, G test of independence with William’s correction), and non-invaded areas con- tained larger fractions of predators, herbivores, and par- asites than invaded areas (Fig. 1, p ? 0.001, G test of in- dependence with William’s correction).....

721,171,Linepithema humile,United States,California,,,,,,,,,,"In coastal California, the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) displaces nearly all above ground foraging native ant species. The loss of native ants following invasion by Argentine ants homogenizes these faunas; natural habitats invaded by L. humile have lower beta diversity compared to comparable uninvaded areas. Argentine ant abundance in the seasonally dry mediterranean environments of this region correlates strongly and posi- tively with soil moisture. For this reason, the displacement of native ants across natural and artificial moisture gradients often resembles an edge effect, the magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile. The direct effects of Argentine ant invasions in natural environments are therefore amplified by inputs of urban and agricultural run off. Indirect ecological effects of these invasions arise from the loss of large-bodied ants, arid adapted ants, and behav- ioral repertoires unique to particular native ant species.... Native ant displacement by Argentine ants is known from many parts of the world, especially from seasonally dry med- iterranean-type ecosystems (Tremper, 1976; Ward, 1987; Bond and Slingsby, 1984; Cammell et al., 1994; Carpintero et al., 2004). The effects of Argentine ants on native ants are per- haps best known for California where numerous studies have found that L. humile displaces nearly every species of above ground foraging native ant (reviewed in Holway et al., 2002a). Our fine scale mapping of ant nests at the UC Elliot Chaparral Reserve clearly reveals the extent of this displace- ment (Fig. 1). We detected 116 nest entrances of 8 species of native ant species in the uninvaded plot but found only Argentine ants (and 69 nest entrances) in the invaded plot. Although the majority of native ants in California succumb to Argentine ants, a few species persist. These exceptions include hypogeics (e.g., species that are leaf litter dwelling or below ground foraging), and the winter active Prenolepis imparis (Ward, 1987; Holway, 1998; Suarez et al., 1998; Sanders et al., 2001; see also DiGirolamo and Fox, in press).... Existing data, however, illus- trate the homogenizing potential of L. humile invasions. In both northern and southern California, estimates of beta diversity between paired invaded and uninvaded riparian sites exhibit entirely non-overlapping distributions (Fig. 3A and B). This disparity holds as well for comparisons between northern and southern California (Fig. 3C), suggesting that, even across large spatial scales and in the absence of urban- ization, invasion by Argentine ants leads to increased faunal similarity. For large habitat fragments in urban San Diego, estimates of beta diversity are again lower at invaded sites compared to uninvaded sites (Fig. 3D). However, it is not possible to tease apart the independent impacts of invasion versus urbanization with this example.",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,"MV impacts?

Apparently only one native ant species is able to coexist with the Argentine ant, the cryptic Plagiolepis pygmaea. Ant worker abundance was also modified after the invasion: the number of Argentine ant workers detected, which represented 92% of the invaded zone, was two times higher than the number of native ant workers detected in the non-invaded zone. The total ant biomass was inversely affected, becoming four times lower in the invaded zone highly dominated by Linepithema humile. The higher number of Argentine ant workers and their fast tempo of activity implied an alteration of the intensity of soil surface searching: scanning by the Argentine ants in the invaded zone was higher than that done by the native ants in the non-invaded zone, and the estimated time for a complete soil surface scan was 64 minutes in the invaded zone and 108 minutes in the non-invaded zone. Consequently, resources will be discovered faster by ants in the invaded zone than in the non-invaded zone. The increase of the mean temperature and the decrease of the relative humidity from May to August reduced the ant activity in the two study zones but this reduction was greater in the invaded zone....

Many species, such as the big headed ant (Pheidole megacephala), the little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata), the imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile,formerly Iridomyrmex humilis) have wreaked ecological havoc where they have become established (Williams 1994). Most of the impact of these species has been measured in loss of native ant diversity, which is greatly reduced or completely eliminated in areas where they have invaded.... 9.3.1 Ant Communities of Coastal Scrub Fragments in Southern California - Within fragments, the number of native ant species detected at any sample array decreased in the presence of the Argentine ant from an average of almost seven to two (Fig. 9.2). The average number of Argentine ants per jar was negatively correlated with the distance to the nearest urban edge (Fig. 9.3a).... Among fragments, bivariate regressions reveal that log area (R2=0.441, P<0.0001) and percent native vegetation (R2=0.349,P<0.0001) were positively correlated, while log age (R2=0.152, P<0.02) and log Argentine ant activity (R2=0.483, P<0.0001) were negatively correlated with the remaining number of native ants species within a fragment (Fig. 9.5)....

We studied the dynamics of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, for 7 years in Jasper Ridge, a biological preserve in northern California. We monitored the distributions at the hectare scale of native ant taxa and L. humile in the spring and fall from 1993 to 1999. We also studied the invasion dy- namics at a finer resolution by searching for ants in 1-m2 plots. Our results are similar at both scales. The distribu- tions of several native species are not random with re- gard to L. humile; the distributions of several epigeic species with similar habitat affinities overlap much less frequently than expected with the distribution of L. hu- mile. We found that season had a significant influence on the distributions of L. humile and several native taxa. Over the 7-year period, L. humile has increased its range size in Jasper Ridge largely at the expense of native taxa, but there is seasonal and yearly variation in this rate of increase. Studies of invasions in progress which sample across seasons and years may help to predict the spread and effects of invasive species.....

Argentine ants recruited to baits in invaded areas, on average, in less than half the time of native ants in uninvaded areas. Despite the loss of epigeic native ants, higher Argentine ant worker abundance, and faster recruitment by Argentine ants at invaded sites, pitfall trap samples from uninvaded and invaded areas contained similar abundances and diver- sities of non-ant arthropods.

Invasive ants are frequently associated with declines in the diversity of ground-dwelling arthropods but also may affect plants through their attraction to floral nectar and tending of hemipterans. Protea nitida is a tree native to the South African fynbos that hosts a native membracid, Beaufortiana sp., which is tended by ants. Here I compare Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) to native ants in their attraction to P. nitida inflorescences in the presence and absence of the membracid, and their effects on other floral arthropod visitors, seed set, and ovule pr?dation. Argentine ant discovery of inflorescences increased at least 13-fold when membracids were present on the branch, whereas native ant discovery of inflorescences was only doubled by membracid presence at one site in one study year and was unaffected in the other three site-years. Excluding Argentine ants from inflorescences resulted in an increase in several arthropod taxa and potential pollinators; native ant exclusion had no positive effects. Thus the mutualism between Argentine ants and the membracid is facilitating pollinator deterrence by the ants. Though Argentine ants were not associated with a decline in P. nitida seed set or ovule pr?dation, declines in generalist insect pollinators may have ramifications for the 83% of fynbos plants that are insect pollinated. Pitfall traps showed that Argentine ants were not more abundant than native ants in non-invaded sites. Focusing only on abundance on the ground and displacement of ground dwelling arthropod fauna may lead to an underestimate of the effects of invasive ants on their adopted communities....Table2",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Lach_2007a,2007,Lach L. 2007.

L. humile is now widely distributed mainly in urban areas and surrounding secondary vegetation of the cities Hatsukaichi and Hiroshima. The impact assessment suggested that L. humile reduced species diversity of local, indigenous ant communities. There was differential sensitivity of indigenous ant species to the invasion of L. humile. Some ant species disappeared in parks infested with L. humile; for example, Pheidole noda, Pheidole indica and Lasius japonicus. L. humile seemed to be superior to these ant species in certain traits and habits, such as mobility, recruitment ability, aggressiveness and omnivory. In contrast, Paratrechina sakurae and Camponotus vitiosus were less affected by L. humile infestation. The mechanisms allowing such coexistence seemed to be small body size (P. sakurae) and arboreal nesting habits (C. vitiosus).... The results suggest that mass-foraging species (T. tsushimae, P. pungens, P. noda, P. indica and L. japonicus) and/or honeydew-using (i.e. aphid- tending) species (P. pungens, O. glaber and L. japonicus) are adversely affected by infestation with L. humile, strongly indicating severe competition. These are common or dominant species in urban areas not infested with L. humile, their prosperity perhaps due to their feeding habits (i.e. mass-foraging and/or aphid- tending).

Among sites, diversity was negatively related to stability as measured by resistance to overall compositional change, but this effect could not be separated from the strong negative effect of invasive ant density on compositional stability.

This ecosystem lacks native ants but possesses many locally endemic and rare anthropod species. Pitfall trapping and under-rock surveys were conducted to determine the effects of I. humilis on the local arthropod fauna. More than 180 taxa were sampled, mostly Arthropoda. Presence of the Argentine ant is associated with reduced populations of many native and non-native anthropod species, including important predator species and major pollinators of native plants. Effects of ant invasion were particularly severe at higher elevations of Haleakala volcano where endemic species normally exist at low densities. Some taxa, primarily alien species, were more abundant in the presence of ants. Invasion of the Argentine ant has locally reduced the abundance of many endemic species in the shrubland ecosystem. Although the spread of this ant species is slow, I. humilis appears to have the potential to invade a much larger area of Haleakala National Park than it now occupies.

Significantly more seeds were removed from ant-accessible seed stations at sites numerically dominat- ed by a common harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex subni- tidus), a native disperser of these seeds and a species sensitive to displacement by L. humile, than from those stations at sites where L. humile was in the majority. Predation of seeds was high, but variable, across sites, suggesting that reduced dispersal could result in increased seed predation in some habitats. Removal of elaiosomes did not affect the frequency with which predators removed seeds, but ants removed significantly more seeds with elaiosomes than without. In behavior trials, only P. subnitidus was able to carry seeds of Dendrome- con rigida effectively. L. humile and a small native ant species, Dorymyrmex insanus, while displaying interest in the diaspores, were seldom able to carry whole seeds and, when they did, only carried them a few centimeters. Displacement of native harvester ants by L. humile appears to decrease the dispersal of Dendromecon rigida seeds and may be increasing loss of seeds due to predation ....

In the greenhouse, as in the field, foliar foraging by ants greatly increased when aphids were present.

Larger seedswere generally taken last by all ant species monitored, exceptPolygalamyrtifoliaseeds which, despite being larger than those of Agathosmaovata, were selected first more often and dispersed more readily by all ant species. L. humile failed to disperse any of the larger elaiosome-bearing seeds such as those of Podalyria calyptrata, Paranomus reflexus and Leucospermum cordifolium, unlike Pheidole capensis, which has similarly- sized workers and a large soldier caste. Nest entrance measurements revealed that large seeds such as those of P. reflexusand L.cordifoliumwere too large to be accommodated in the nests of small ant species aswell as most of the large ant species. In these cases, seeds were discarded on the soil surface where some of the benefits of myrmecochory, including protection of seeds from desiccation and rodent predation, would not be realised. The study showed that myrmecochorous plants with small seeds will probably not be affected to the same extent as those with large seeds by the displacement of large species of ants by L.humile.The inability of native ant species to accommodate largemyrmecochorous seeds in nests also brings into question some of the apparent benefits of this ant-plant interaction.... From this study it is clear that a small ant species such as L. humile is capable of dispersing small seeds but not large elaiosome-bearing seeds. Although some of the larger seeds in L. humile- invaded areas may be dispersed by T. quadri- spinosum and O. cilliei, which can co-exist with L. humile, the absence of species like P. capensis and Anoplolepisspp. will result in an overall reduc- tion in the dispersal of large ones. The study also indicated that the dispersal of seeds, especially large seeds, may be the only real benefit of myrmecochory, considering that the nest entrances of most ant species are too small to accommodate bigger seeds.

The presence of L. humile implies the displacement of all native ant species that disperse seeds. Seed transports in the non-invaded zone were carried out by eight ant species. In the invaded zone, L. humile workers removed and transported seeds to the nest. In vertebrate exclusion trials, we observed the same level of seed removal in the invaded and non-invaded zones. Two findings could explain this result. Although mean time to seed localization was higher for native ants (431.7 s) than that for L. humile (150.5 s), the mean proportion ofseeds transported after being detected was higher (50.1%) in non-invaded than in invaded (16.8%) zones. The proportion of seeds removed and transported into an ant nest after an ant-seed interaction had dramatically reduced from non-invaded (41.9%) to invaded (7.4%) zones. The levels of seed dispersal by ants found prior to invasion are unlikely to be maintained in invaded zones.

High levels of ant attendance resulted in signiÞcantly higher densities ofboth aphids and their predators over the course of the 5-mo experiment.

Removal of elaiosomes did not affect the frequency with which predators removed seeds, but ants removed significantly more seeds with elaiosomes than without.

L. humile was found at all six study sites and varied in relative abundance from 18.6% of the total number of ants at Pogo 6 to 87.0% at Arg 4. L. humile was numerically dominant at four sites: Arg 1, Arg 2, Arg 4, and Arg 5. P. subnitidus was the numerically dominant ant at the remaining two sites: Pogo 3 and Pogo 6.... Although the number of seeds removed across all treatments did not differ significantly between L. humile sites and P. subnitidus sites, the treatment by ant interaction was a significant source of variation (P=0.007), indicating that P. subnitidus sites and L. humile sites differed in their pattern of seed removal (Table 2, Fig. 1). In fact, more seeds were removed from the ant-accessible treatments in the P. subnitidus sites than in the L. humile sites (t=-3.79, df=12, P=0.0026).",1,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,REVIEWED (Rodriguez_Cabal et al_2009) Argentine ant disruption of seed-disperasal mutualism,Carney et al_2003,2003,"Carney SE, Brooke Byerley M, Holway DA. 2003.

distributed among invaded sites (n=76) and uninvaded sites (n= 37).... Eighteen native ant species visited cacti in uninvaded areas, but cacti in invaded areas were primarily visited by the Argentine ant. The main herbivore of the coast barrel cactus present at the study sites is a leaf-footed bug (Narnia wilsoni).... Although the Argentine ant might provide superior protection from herbivores, invasion-induced reductions in ant mutualist diversity could potentially compromise plant reproduction. The cumulative number of ant species on individual cacti over time
was lower in invaded areas and was associated with a shortened seasonal duration of ant protection and reduced seed mass. These results support the hypothesis that multiple partners may enhance mutualism benefits... Although the Argentine ant may provide superior protection from herbivores (compared to native ants as a whole), it also reduces ant mutualist diversity (Table 1), which was positively related to seed mass (Fig. 4). These positive and negative aspects of Argentine ant presence appear to balance each other out as estimates of seed mass for cacti in invaded areas, and uninvaded areas did not differ.",0,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,dubious,Ludka et al_2015,2015,"Ludka J, Levan KE, Holway DA. 2015.

High and low levels of ant attendance were established for a 5-mo evaluation of the densities of ant attended aphids, aphid predators, and leaf miners, which are subject to ant-induced damage of the mines. High levels of ant attendance resulted in signiÞcantly higher densities ofboth aphids and their predators over the course of the 5-mo experiment. A complementary short-term (20-d) experiment revealed that (1) aphid populations in ant-attended colonies increased in size and persisted longer than those in nonÐant- attended colonies, and (2) aphid predators remained more abundant on nonÐant-attended aphid colonies until the colonies went locally extinct. There were no signiÞcant effects of ants on the densities of the two common leaf miners, Amauromyza maculosa and Liriomyza trifolii, despite a signiÞcantly greater number of ant-damaged mines on trees in the high ant density treatment. The results ofthis experiment suggest that ant tending by L. humile on B. halimifolia may only impact those insects normally involved in the antÐaphid mutualism and not all herbivores of this host plant....

1119,569,Linepithema humile,United States,California,,,,"Maintaining biodiversity within fragmented landscapes has become a primary focus of ecology. Despite many theoretical and comparative studies on species per- sistence following fragmentation, experimental studies investigating the mechanisms behind population declines remain rare. In recent years, coastal horned lizards (Phrynosoma coronatum) have disappeared throughout much of their range in coastal southern California. In addition to the direct impact of habitat loss due to urbanization, horned lizard populations continue to decline in the remaining fragmented landscape. One factor that may contribute to their decline is the invasion of exotic species from the surrounding urban matrix. Horned lizards are ant specialists, and they may be particularly vulnerable to changes in the native ant community resulting from the invasion of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). In this study we examined how Argentine ants influence horned lizard growth rates by raising hatchlings on prey typical of invaded and uninvaded sites. Hatchling horned lizards main- tained positive growth rates on a diet of just one native ant species (Crematogaster cali- fornica). However, on a diet of Argentine ants or arthropods typical of an invaded com- munity, horned lizard growth rates were either negative or averaged near zero. In addition, when lizards were switched from a diet of Argentine ants to native ants, growth rates increased. One factor contributing to growth was foraging rate; capture success appears partly responsible for why horned lizards specialize on ants vs. other, harder to capture, arthropods. Moreover, a comparison of diets among age classes of coastal horned lizards suggests a diversity of ants is necessary to support lizard populations. While stochastic demographic and environmental processes are often invoked to explain the decline of populations following fragmentation, it appears that horned lizards are disappearing from habitat remnants in southern California at least in part due to the deterministic effects of a biological invasion.",4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Suarez & Case_2002,2002,"Suarez A V, Case TJ. 2002.

1188,638,Linepithema humile,,,,,,,,,"Invasive species displace native species and potentially alter the structure and function of ecological communities. In this study, we compared the generic composition of intact and invaded ant communities from 12 published studies and found that invasive ant species alter the phylogenetic structure of native ant communities. Intact ant communities were phylogenetically evenly dispersed, suggesting that competition structures communities. However, in the presence of an invasive ant species, these same communities were phylo- genetically clustered. Phylogenetic clustering in invaded communities suggests that invasive species may act as strong environmental filters and prune the phylogenetic tree of native species in a nonrandom manner, such that only a few closely related taxa can persist in the face of a biological invasion. Taxa that were displaced by invasive ant species were evenly dispersed in the phylogeny, suggesting that diversity losses from invasive ant species are not clustered in particular lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that there is strong phylogenetic structuring in intact native ant communities, but the spread of invasive species disassembles those communities above and beyond the effect of simple reductions in diversity..... We compiled data on the composition of ant communities by searching Web of Science and Google Scholar using the key words ants, invasive, invasion, community, richness, diversity, and structure on 30 November 2007. From this search we selected studies that (1) explicitly compared invaded and un-invaded (i.e., ‘‘intact’’) communities, and (2) used standardized, quantitative sampling methods (Longino and Colwell 1997) to quantify ant community structure in both the invaded and intact sites.

971,421,Monomorium floricola,Galapagos,Galapagos,"We investigated the threat of aliens on pollination networks in the species-rich lowlands of five Galapagos Islands. Twenty per cent of all species (60 plants and 220 pollinators) in the pooled network were aliens, being involved in 38 per cent of the interactions. Most aliens were insects, especially dipterans (36%), hymenopterans (30%) and lepidopterans (14%). These alien insects had more links than either endemic pollinators or non-endemic natives, some even acting as island hubs. Aliens linked mostly to generalized species, increasing nestedness and thus network stability. Moreover, they infiltrated all seven connected modules (determined by geo- graphical and phylogenetic constraints) of the overall network, representing around 30 per cent of species in two of them. An astonishingly high pro- portion (38%) of connectors, which enhance network cohesiveness, was also alien. Results indicate that the structure of these emergent novel communities might become more resistant to certain type of disturbances (e.g. species loss), while being more vulnerable to others (e.g. spread of a disease). Such notable changes in network structure as invasions progress are expected to have important consequences for native biodiversity maintenance.... The potential invader complexes were also located in these two modules in which mostly alien ants, bees and wasps were involved.

The tramp ant Monomorium pharaonis (L.) was found to be abundant in storm-petrel nesting areas on Laysan Island. There were 380 observations made on incubating adults and 798 observations for chicks, for a total of 1178 observations from 116 storm-petrel nest sites. No ant harassment events involving incubating adult storm-petrels were recorded. Thirteen instances of more than 5 ants on Tristram’s Storm-petrel chicks were recorded. One harassment event was recorded, involving approximately 200 ants. The chick left the nest site immediately following the event, did not return, and presumably died. The number of nest failures attributed to M. pharaonis was 1% (n = 116). There was a significant relationship between nest type and ant interactions (G = 24.45, p = <0.0001, n =55), with incidents only recorded from birds nesting under vegetation. It was hypothesized that the ant interactions recorded in this study were a result of Tristram’s Storm-petrel chicks being in close proximity to M. pharaonis nests rather than direct predation. Thus no evidence was found of a severe impact of invasive ants on the breeding success of storm-petrels at Laysan Island.

594,44,Myrmica rubra,United States,Appledore Island (Maine),,,,"Here we report on the first documented effects of Myrmica rubra, the European fire ant, on the reproduction of birds in its non-native range. We documented herring gulls (Larus argentatus) on Appledore Island, Maine, engaging in more erratic incubation behaviors at nests infested by the ants. Newly-hatched chicks in some nests were swarmed by ants, leading to rapid chick death. Due to high overall rates of chick mortality, survival probabilities did not vary between nests with and without ant activity, however chick growth rates were slower at nests with ants than at ant-free nests. Ant infestation likely leads to longer-term fitness consequences because slower growth rates early in life may ultimately lead to lower post-fledging survival probabilities.... Chick growth was measured for 81 chicks located in 39 nests from the vegetated areas of the island (17 with ant activity). Chick weight was influenced by the presence of ants in the nest (F1,271 = 8.50, p = 0.004) after controlling for chick age (F1,271 = 1144.9, p,0.001) and position in the hatching order (F2,271 = 8.94, p,0.001). On average, chicks in nests without ant activity grew more rapidly than did chicks in nests with ant activity (Fig. 2), chicks gained weight with age, and older chicks weighed more than younger siblings. The same differences in growth were detected using a measure of structural size (head+bill length), with the presence of ants (F1,271 = 4.10, p = 0.044), chick age (F1,271 = 2521.6, p,0.001), and position in the hatching order (F2,271 = 5.16, p = 0.006) all effecting size. No differences were detected in chick survival rates through day 5 as a function of the presence or absence of ants at the nest (x2 82 = 0.04, p = 0.85). The proportion of chicks that died in the first 5 days was nearly identical at nests with ants (0.16) as at ant- free nests (0.17). Ants were observed swarming over newly hatched chicks in five nests. Swarming was concentrated around the bill and the eyes of the chicks, with the skin around the eyes often swollen and red in color. Chicks responded to the ants by shaking their heads and stomping their feet. When handled, some chicks were listless and unable to support their head. Ofthe twelve chicks affected in the swarmed nests, six were found dead in the nest within two days of the initial observations and six survived.... Incubating herring gulls engaged in significantly more erratic behavior when ant activity was observed at the nest. Adult birds preened frequently, shook their wings and bills, and frequently left and resettled on the nest. This and other erratic behavior, such as scratching, pecking, and hopping, has been documented in other incubating birds exposed to aggressive invasive ants",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,DeFisher & Boner_2013,2013,"DeFisher LE, Bonter DN. 2013.

632,82,Myrmica rubra,United States,Maine,"Field experiments demonstrated higher diaspore removal rates over a 10-min and 24-h period by M. rubra compared to native ants. M. rubra’s diaspore dispersal distance was 40% greater compared to native ants. In two of three laboratory studies and one field study, there was no significant difference between the seed species which M. rubra and native ants selected. Our data suggest no long-term deleterious effects of M. rubra’s invasion on diaspore dispersal in the Maine plant community that is comprised of both native and invasive species. This implies that M. rubra benefits from the myrmechorous plant species’ diaspores by increasing their dispersal range away from the parent plant and potentially reducing seed predation. However, it is not known whether the fact that the native ant fauna and M. rubra are attracted to the same plant species’ diaspores creates a high level of competition between the ants with deleterious effects on the native ant community",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Gammans et al_2018,2018,"Gammans N, Drummond F, Groden E. 2018.

647,97,Myrmica rubra,Canada,Ontario,"Here we show how invasion by a seed-dispersing ant (Myrmica rubra) promotes recruitment of a co-introduced invasive over native ant-dispersed (myrmecochorous) plants. We created experimental communities of invasive (M. rubra) or native ants (Aphaenogaster rudis) and invasive and native plants and measured seed disper- sal and plant recruitment. In our mesocosms, and in laboratory and field trials, M. rubra acted as a superior seed disperser relative to the native ant. By contrast, previous studies have found that invasive ants are often poor seed dispersers compared with native ants. Despite belonging to the same behavioural guild, seed-dispersing ants were not functionally redundant. Instead, native and inva- sive ants hadstronglydivergent effects onplant communities: the invasive plant dominated in the presence of the invasive ant and thenativeplants dominated in the presence of the native ant. Community changes were not due to preferences for coevolved partners: variation in functional traits of linked partners drove differences. Here, we show that strongly interacting introduced mutualists can be major drivers of ecological change.",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Prior et al_2015,2015,"Prior KM, Robinson JM, Dunphy SAM, Frederickson ME, Prior KM. 2015.

In this study, we compared the generic composition of intact and invaded ant communities from 12 published studies and found that invasive ant species alter the phylogenetic structure of native ant communities. Intact ant communities were phylogenetically evenly dispersed, suggesting that competition structures communities. However, in the presence of an invasive ant species, these same communities were phylo- genetically clustered. Phylogenetic clustering in invaded communities suggests that invasive species may act as strong environmental filters and prune the phylogenetic tree of native species in a nonrandom manner, such that only a few closely related taxa can persist in the face of a biological invasion. Taxa that were displaced by invasive ant species were evenly dispersed in the phylogeny, suggesting that diversity losses from invasive ant species are not clustered in particular lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that there is strong phylogenetic structuring in intact native ant communities, but the spread of invasive species disassembles those communities above and beyond the effect of simple reductions in diversity..... We compiled data on the composition of ant communities by searching Web of Science and Google Scholar using the key words ants, invasive, invasion, community, richness, diversity, and structure on 30 November 2007. From this search we selected studies that (1) explicitly compared invaded and un-invaded (i.e., ‘‘intact’’) communities, and (2) used standardized, quantitative sampling methods (Longino and Colwell 1997) to quantify ant community structure in both the invaded and intact sites.

642,92,Nylanderia fulva,United States,Texas,,,,,,,"N. fulva rapidly attains densities up to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the combined abundance of all other ants. Overall ant biomass increases in invaded habitat, indicating that N. fulva exploits resources not fully utilized by the local ant assemblage. At high density, as N. fulva spreads, it eliminates the current ecologically dominant invasive ant, red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). Compared to imported fire ant dominated habitat, N. fulva invasion zones have lower non-ant arthropod species richness and abundance with impacts differing by trophic category. Further, N. fulva reduces abundance and species richness of the remainder of the ant assemblage and does so in a non-random manner: impacting species with small sized workers much less than species with larger workers. In these and other ant assemblages with a large exotic component, the exotics tend to be small bodied species. As a result, N. fulva almost completely eliminates regionally distributed species, but leaves globally distributed species largely unaffected, thereby systematically favoring introduced over native diversity. S. invicta impacts wildlife and arthropod assemblage structure and is nearly ubiquitous in non-forested habitats of the Southeastern United States and Texas. Its displacement by N. fulva has critical implications for the natural systems of this region.... Remarkably, at both sites, as populations of N. fulva spread, populations of the current ecological dominant, red imported fire ants (S. invicta), declined or were eliminated..... At the HD site, Nf-abundant areas exhibited significantly lower ant species density than Nf-scarce areas (Z test: N = 22, Z = 3.21, P\0.002) (Fig. 2). When S. invicta was removed, this difference persisted (Ztest: N = 22, Z = 2.27, P\0.02), demonstrating a wider loss of diversity. At the MD site, the same pattern of lower ant species density in areas behind the N. fulva invasion front held, however, the difference was not significant (Z test: N = 18, Z = 1.76, P = 0.07) (Fig. 2)..... At both sites, the abundances of ants other than S. invicta and N. fulva were significantly reduced by the expanding N. fulva population. These impacts were specific to the body sizes of species. Large bodied ant species were considerably more likely to be negatively impacted by N. fulva than were small bodied species (Logistic regression of impact versus: Head width largest worker: N = 16, b1 = 10.07, rL 2 = 0.56, P\0.0005; Dry mass of average worker: N = 16, b1 = 9.05, rL 2 = 0.31, P\0.01). In fact, abundance of all species larger than about 0.7 mm head width declined (Fig. 3).",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,density dependence,LeBrun et al_2013,2013,"LeBrun EG, Abbott J, Gilbert LE. 2013.

Workers tend various honeydew producing he- mipterans in Florida landscapes and natural areas. We sought to understand the seasonal foraging activities of N. fulva and its relationship with honeydew producing hemipterans. Twenty-two hemipteran species were collected from 15 different plant hosts sampled in Flor- ida from Jul 2010 to Jul 2012. The relative density of hemipterans on 4 plant species [live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.; Fagales: Fagaceae), holly (Ilex cornuta Lindl.; Aquifoliales: Aquifoliaceae), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.; Magnoliales: Magnoliaceae), and sugar- berry (Celtis laevigata Willd.; Urticales: Ulmaceae)] was compared to the relative density of N. fulva at the base or stem of the selected plants. The number of N. fulva and hemipterans on each plant species was positively correlated from spring through fall. Both N. fulva and hemipteran populations increased from May to Sep and decreased from Oct to Apr. In addi- tion, Cinara juniperivora (Wilson) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on southern red cedar and Tou- meyella liriodendri (Gmelin) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) on magnolia were covered with carton shelters presumably constructed by N. fulva, suggesting that this ant potentially protects certain hemipterans species.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,"no impacts described, assumed damage to host plants",Sharma et al_2013,2013,"Sharma S, Oi DH, Buss EA. 2013.

653,103,Nylanderia vaga,New Caledonia,New Caledonia,,,,,,,"We conducted a systematic baiting survey of 56 sites representing the main New Caledonian habitat types: rainforest on ultramafic soils (15 sites), rainforest on volcano-sedimentary soils (13), maquis shrubland (15), Melaleuca-dominated savannas (11) and Acacia spirorbis thickets (2). We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion.... When excluding exotic species and considering rainforest sites only (n = 23), we found a significant difference in community composition between sites that belonged to the ‘pristine’ group (Group 1) and sites that were dominated by exotic species in the previous analysis (Groups 2 and 3). This was true at the species (ANOSIM global R = 0.53, P<0.01; Fig. 6), genus (ANOSIM global R = 0.70, P<0.001) and functional group (ANOSIM global R = 0.71, P<0.001) levels, and was independent of the substrate type (ANOSIM P>0.05 in all cases). The RELATE procedure revealed no significant relationship between the similarity matrices of ant community composition and of habitat variables (? = 0.07; P = 0.26).

One of the major problems we have encountered in drip irrigation is that ants chew through the tube walls and enlarge the orifices along the length of the tube. This changes the hydraulic characteristics of the system, causing, a reduction of water pressure resulting to an uneven water distribution. If the problem is not corrected, it could result, in heavy yield losses in some parts of the field due to poor plant growth caused by severe water shortage.

On this island, the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala has caused serious indirect damage to the threatened native Pisonia grandis trees via a mutualism with an invasive scale insect, Pulvinaria urbicola. We aimed to suppress the ant, thereby decoupling the mutualism and enabling recovery of the Pisonia trees. We treated all areas where ant pressure was high with a selective formicidal bait, which was deployed in custom-made bait stations designed to avoid risk of treatment to endemic fauna. In the treated area, ant foraging activity was reduced by 93 percent and was followed by a 100 percent reduction in scale insect density. Abundance of endemic herbivorous insects and herbivorous activity increased significantly, however, after the decline in mutualistic species densities. Despite the native herbivore increase, there was considerable overall improvement in Pisonia shoot condition and an observed increase in foliage density.... The 8-ha area of high ant density was treated with a single application of the commercial hydramethylnon-based for- micidal bait, Siege® in June/July 2010... Forty 10 9 10 m permanent monitoring plots were selected on the island. Twenty plots were within the 8-ha baited area and 20 were outside the baited area (Fig. S1)....

We found no significant correlations in landscape-scale spatial overlap and abundance between the ant and the millipede. Furthermore, the ant did not attack healthy millipedes, but fed only on dying and dead indi- viduals. The chemical defences of the millipede protected it from ant predation. Ingestion of the bait at standard concentration had no obvious impact on the millipede.

Our results show that the predation on bait eggs was limited to the ground surface. This stratum is dominated by three invasive omnivorous ants: Pheidole megacephala and Solenopsis geminata strongly increased the predation rate of bait eggs, whereas Brachymyrmex cordemoyi was responsible for only a small decrease in predation rate. Predation rate was positively related to predator species richness, and was negatively related to omnivore species richness. The negative relationship between the predation rate and omnivore species richness is caused by the most dominant invasive ant, P. megacephala, which reduces omnivore richness and seems to strongly prey on eggs....

We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion.... When excluding exotic species and considering rainforest sites only (n = 23), we found a significant difference in community composition between sites that belonged to the ‘pristine’ group (Group 1) and sites that were dominated by exotic species in the previous analysis (Groups 2 and 3).

These two species excel at both the dis- covery and domination of resources, and could have ‘disassembled’ the native ant fauna. Recent surveys and ecological studies from other Pacific islands show that a very similar set of invasive species to the Yasawa islands are ubiquitous throughout the region.... Species diversity was the lowest on the three islands that were numerically dominated by a single species (low 1/D ratio) (Table 2): Tavewa, which was dominated by Pheidole megacephala; and Naviti and Kuata, which were dominated by Anoplolepis gracilipes. Pairwise comparisons from ANOSIM showed that the overall ant composition of islands were very similar (Table 3). The differences (defined as R> 0.5, Clarke and Warwick, 2005) that existed between islands in the composition of ant species are largely attributable to the frequency of two species, P. megacephala and A. gracilipes. For example, P. megacephala was wide- spread and abundant in the coconut plantations of Tavewa, but were absent from this habitat on Matacawalevu and Nanuya lailai. A. gracilipes was verycommon in forest on Naviti and Kuata, but was recorded only once in forest on Tavewa..... there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that ant assemblages in the Yasawa islands are competitively structured.

681,131,Pheidole megacephala,Portugal,Madeira,,,,,,,"1. The earliest exotic records for two notorious invasive ants, the big-headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ) and the Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ), both come from the Atlantic islands of Madeira, where the two species underwent population explosions in the 1850s and 1890s respectively. Researchers have long assumed that these invaders spread across all of Madeira and exterminated most or all native ants, despite no research actually documenting such impact. 2. Re-examination of first-hand nineteenth century accounts suggest that P. megacephala and L. humile may never have spread beyond coastal lowland areas, representing < 10% of Madeira’s land area. In 2002, native ants dominated most of Madeira’s land area respectively. Madeira; P. megacephala and L. humile were restricted to ? 0.3% and ? 6% of 3. Of the 10 native ant species known from Madeira, only one ( Temnothorax wollastoni ) was not present in 1999 – 2002 surveys. Although exotic ants may have exterminated T. wollastoni , it seems likely that this species still survives. 4. Thus, even after 150 or more years of residence, P. megacephala and L. humile have come to occupy only a small part of Madeira, and appear to have had little impact. 5. Most of Madeira may be too cool for P. megacephala and perhaps too moist for L. humile to dominate. Also, Madeira’s vast natural areas may generally lack weedy vegetation that can support high densities of plant-feeding Hemiptera critical for the ecological dominance of invasive ants. Finally, a dominant native ant, Lasius grandis , inhabiting ? 84% of Madeira, may actively exclude P. megacephala and L. humile .",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Wetterer et al_2006,2006,"Wetterer JK, Espadaler X, Wetterer AL, Aguin-Pombo D, Franquinho-Aguiar AM. 2006.

Pre- treatment, the impact of P. megacephala on the native ant fauna was clear. Native ant abundance and species richness were almost always significantly lower in infested compared to uninfested samples. Multivariate analysis statistically separated sample grids from infested and uninfested areas. Following treatment, no P. megacephala individuals were detected for 2 years and it was therefore declared eradicated. Ecological recovery post treatment was also clear. Twenty-one months post-treatment, native ant abun- dance and species richness within the treated (infested) area were always almost always significantly greater than in the pre-treatment sample, corresponding with no change in the control area (uninfested area). Total species richness from plots in the treated area was identical to that from plots in the control area. Multivariate analysis showed no statistical separation of the treated or control plots. Species richness within lure plots displayed no trend within the treated area relative to the treatment boundary or locations away from the treated area. This project demonstrates the feasibility of eradicating this ant, and that ecological systems are capable of recovering following removal of an exotic invader..... In the 2006 samples, native ant abundance was significantly lower in infested compared to uninfested samples in both the grids (Unpaired t-test, t = 4.7, P\0.0001; Fig. 2a) and transects (Unpaired t-test, t = 5.07, P\0.0001; Fig. 3a).

Total species richness within the infested grids was just over half of that in the uninfested grids (7 vs. 11). The relationship ofP. megacephala abundance with native ant abundance and species richness was always negative, but only the regression of ant abundance from transect samples proved significant (R2 = 0.223, P = 0.012).

However, the introduction and establishment of a suite of non-indigenous predators during the historic period was probably also a significant contributing factor, and is inferred to have been the main cause of the declines and extinctions of native snail species in inland Rarotonga over the last 140 years..... Solem (1976: 100–101; 1983: 97) has argued that predation of snails and their eggs by introduced ants was an important cause of recent declines and extinctions of species of ground-dwelling endodontoid snails on Rarotonga and other tropical Pacific islands. No native ants are known from Rarotonga (or elsewhere in eastern Polynesia), but 26 exotic species have been recorded on the island, all presumed to have been accidentally introduced as a result of human activities.... Nothing is known about the present and historical ecology of ants on Rarotonga.... Solem (1976: 100–101; 1990: 34) noted that endodontid snails were typically absent on Polynesian islands where introduced ants were abundant. He suggested that predation of eggs and juveniles by ants, particularly Pheidole megacephala, was probably one of the primary causes of endodontid declines and extinctions in eastern Polynesia.... A lack of detailed information on the history of ant
invasions on Rarotonga, and on the feeding behaviour of the various ant species involved, means that it is not possible to determine whether or not ants could have caused, or contri buted to, the documented declines and extinctions of low land and montane snails on this island. However, the time lag between declines/extinctions of lowland endemics and inland endemics is certainly consistent with the kind of pattern that would be expected if elimination by invasive ants that established first in the lowlands, and subsequently spread inland, was a key factor.

Sixteen of 20 recorded nest predation events occurred at night, between 20h30 and 04h00, and 65% of nests were predated by cats ( n = 13 nests; Figure 1 ), probably including both domestic and feral cats. Camera footage also showed rats ( n = 3) and mynas ( n = 2), taking a smaller proportion of nests. At one nest, an egg at the point of hatching was overcome by ants. From nest visits, the chick was known to be alive when the ants entered the egg. However, it is not known whether the chick would have hatched in the absence of ants.

929,379,Pheidole megacephala,United States,Line Islands / Palmyra Atoll,"Palmyra Atoll, in the Line Islands of the equatorial Pacific, supports one of the largest remaining native stands of Pisonia grandis forest in the tropical Pacific Ocean. In 2003, we surveyed terrestrial arthropods to document extant native and introduced species richness, compare these lists with historical rec- ords, and assess potential threats to native species and ecosystem integrity. In total, 115 arthropod taxa were collected, bringing the total number of taxa re- corded since 1913 to 162. Few native species were collected; most taxa were ac- cidental introductions also recorded from the Hawaiian Islands, the presumed main source of introductions to Palmyra. The overlap with previous historical surveys in 1913 and 1948 was low (<40%), and new species continue to estab- lish, with one species of whitefly reaching pest status between 2003 and 2005. We observed numerous dead or dying large Pisonia grandis, and the green scale Pulvinaria urbicola (Coccidae) was particularly abundant on trees of poor health. Abundant introduced ants, particularly Pheidole megacephala, tended this and other hemipterans feeding on both native and introduced plants. We hypothesize that the Pheidole-Pulvinaria facultative mutualism is causing the decline of Pisonia grandis. Because of the unique properties of Pisonia grandis forest on oceanic atolls, its importance for nesting seabirds, and its alarming global decline, im- mediate conservation efforts should be directed at controlling introduced Hemiptera and disrupting their mutualisms with nonnative ants on Palmyra Atoll.",4,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Handler et al_2008,2008,"Handler AT, Gruner DS, Haines WP, Lange MW, Kaneshiro KY. 2007.

Four plots were sampled; in two the coastal brown ant was present and in two it was absent. The overall abundance of invertebrates did not differ significantly between plots. The abundance of CoUembola did vary significantly, but intraplot variability was large. Mite numbers did not differ significantly between plots, except for the family Laelapidae.... The pitfall traps captured 14 872 invertebrates.
When Acari and Formicidae were excluded, there was no significant difference in the abundance of inver- tebrates between the plots. (Fo.o5(i)3,ioo = 0.47, P = 0.701, n = 8194). Collembola comprised 78% of the arthropod fauna. The symphypleonan family Dicyrtomidae was well represented. Collembola dif- fered significantly in abundance between the plots (a = 0.5, F=9.66, P = 0.0000) but the intraplot variability was also great (P<< 0.0001 in all cases). The F-value for Symphypleona was not significant (a = 0.05). Approximately 3950 mites representing 54 species

Limited unpublished observa- tions of both ant species attacking nesting seabirds exist, but the frequency of attacks or how they affect seabird growth and survival are unknown. Island- wide treatments with hydramethylnon resulted in the eradication of P. megacephala and the temporary reduction of S. geminata densities. No difference in hatching success, growth, or fledging success of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), a common colonial nesting seabird in the Hawaiian Islands was observed on the pair of islets domi- nated by P. megacephala. On islets dominated by S. geminata, ant control resulted in a temporary increase in fledging success. Injury frequency increased dramatically on the untreated islet (8.3– 100%) while remaining the same on the treated islet (27–38%). Severely injured chicks (i.e., chicks that lost [20% of tissue on their feet) weighed signifi- cantly less than uninjured chicks and did not fledge. It is unclear if the chicks were being preyed upon or stung in defense of nearby ant colonies.

Ant invasion was usually associated with significant changes in overall community composition, as measured by Bray- Curtis distances, particularly among endemic subsets of the communities. Changes in mean species richness were also strong at three of the five sites. Among sites, diversity was negatively related to stability as measured by resistance to overall compositional change, but this effect could not be separated from the strong negative effect of invasive ant density on compositional stability. When compositional stability was measured as proportional change in richness, the best predictor of stability among endemic community subsets was endemic richness, with richer communities losing proportionately more species than species-poor communities.",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Krushelnycky & Gillespie_2008,2008,"Krushelnycky PD, Gillespie RG. 2008.

Cricket songs provide a method by which cricket abundance can be assessed. No sites were found to have both an abundant Laupala population and a population of Pheidole megacephala. The data suggest that in eastern Kauai the decline in crickets, and the peculiar distribution patterns observed, can be attributed to predation by this ant..... This is a notoriously aggressive invasive species. The impact of this species on native faunas, once it is established, has been well documented. In eastern Kauai our data suggests that the decline in Laupala is due to the presence of P. megacephala. This species forms enormous polydomous, polygynous colonies.

Ant densities in flowers were high and floral nectar was excessively exploited, which may lead to a re- duced visitation rate of pollinators. However, the ants’ presence on flowers strongly reduced flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth Stenoptilodes littoralis and thus decreased the loss of flowers and buds.

1121,571,Pheidole megacephala,Seychelles,Cousine Island,,,,,,,"...Cousine Island, Seychelles. On this island, the invasive ant Pheidole megacephala has caused serious indirect damage to the threatened native Pisonia grandis trees via a mutualism with an invasive scale insect, Pulvinaria urbicola. We aimed to suppress the ant, thereby decoupling the mutualism and enabling recovery of the Pisonia trees. We treated all areas where ant pressure was high with a selective formicidal bait, which was deployed in custom-made bait stations designed to avoid risk of treatment to endemic fauna. In the treated area, ant foraging activity was reduced by 93 percent and was followed by a 100 percent reduction in scale insect density. Abundance of endemic herbivorous insects and herbivorous activity increased significantly, however, after the decline in mutualistic species densities. Despite the native herbivore increase, there was considerable overall improvement in Pisonia shoot condition and an observed increase in foliage density.... The 8-ha area of high ant density was treated with a single application of the commercial hydramethylnon-based for- micidal bait, Siege® in June/July 2010... Forty 10 9 10 m permanent monitoring plots were selected on the island. Twenty plots were within the 8-ha baited area and 20 were outside the baited area (Fig. S1).... Baiting significantly influenced other herbivore abundance in baited plots over time relative to unbaited plots (Wald Chi- square = 29.9, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1C; Table 1). Herbivore abundance in baited plots increased significantly from a mean of 6 ± 1 individuals per plot before baiting to 44 ± 6 individuals 11 mo after baiting. Herbivores that increased after baiting included Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera, but the greatest increase was observed for two species, Osaka relata (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae) and Epicroesa sp. (Lepidoptera: Heliodinidae), which represented 84 percent of the total number of individuals over the entire study period..... Hemipteran-tending ants can reduce abundance and diversity of unattended herbivorous arthropods on plants through predation and displacement (Kaplan & Eubanks 2005, Styrsky & Eubanks 2007, Rosumek et al. 2009). Ant removal may thus lead to increased population levels of other herbivores, with a corresponding increase in herbivore damage (e.g., Floate & Whitham 1994, Wimp & Whitham 2001). While herbivore abundance and herbivory increased after ant suppression on our island, overall condition of Pisonia improved despite this increase.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,higher impact level and lower confidence? ,Gaigher & Samways_2013,2013,"Gaigher R, Samways MJ. 2013.

These results corroborate another study by one of the authors (Perfecto 1994), in which she reported a competitive asymmetry be- tween S. geminata and P. radoszkowskii, with the latter competitively reducing the former. Although S. geminata has been characterized as an aggressive ant (and this is certainly true at baits), it is a poor competitor that can flourish only when no competitors are present, or when environmental conditions favor it over other species.... In general, Pheidole radoszkowskii was the most common species in both strata and for both years.

Both species consisted of polymorphic workers, and conducted mass raiding upon turtle nests. As a result of the observation of foraging behavior of ant species in 2004 by using food traps, D. laevigatus (a subterranean species) shared the bait with some terrestrial ant species in the early stage of the experiment except P. affinis. However, P. affinis was a terrestrial species and established satellite nests in the traps to occupy the bait. Traps placed in the habitat of Anoplolepis gracilipes were immediately occupied by them during whole experimental period and other terrestrial ant species were not found in the traps. Anoplolepis gracilipes seemed to be the strongest competitor among the terrestrial ant species in Chagar Hutang, which might result in reduction of the population number of P. affinis with the existence of A. gracilipes. As a result, D. laevigatus became a major predator upon turtle nests, which might have caused the high rate of predation incidences in this area in 2004. The elimination of A. gracilipes may reduce predation incidences upon turtle nests by D. laevigatus.",2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Morita et al_2006,2006,"Morita M, Ahmad AH, Chan EH. 2006.

1095,545,Philidris sp.,Indonesia,Sulawesi,,,,,,,"In total we collected 160 ant morphospecies. Reduced ant species richness on the ground and in the trees was significantly correlated with higher mean temperatures while the other factors, including number ofshade trees did not have any significant influence. The abundant and aggressive Philidris species, reduced arboreal ant species richness. It occurred more frequently in warmer, less shaded plots and on older cacao trees, which offer more nesting sites. Integrating the presence of the dominant ant Philidris sp.1 as an additional explanatory variable in the full model (Appendix C) reveals that the presence of Philidris sp.1 was negatively correlated with the species richness of arboreal ants, being the most relevant explanatory variable (Table 2c). On average we found seven instead of 14 ant species per cacao tree when Philidris sp.1 was present (t-test: 95% confid. interval: 1.16–7.76; df= 13.2, p- value = 0.012; Fig. 2). There is also a negative influence of Philidris on species richness ofground-dwelling ant (Table 2d, Appendix C) relevant factor in generalized model, but non-significant in t-test (Fig. 2; t-test: 5% confid. interval: ?0.70 to 4.11; df= 35.1, p- value = 0.16).... We found one single ant species, Philidris sp.1, (Subfamily Dolichoderinae), to be extremely widespread in the study region, dominating the ant fauna in 36 of the 43 plots by abundance and aggressive behavior. It was present on 65% of all tested trees and 30% of the ground bait locations and recruited, relatively to other ant species, high numbers of individuals to the baits. This ant species shows a pronounced aggressiveness against intruders: farmers complain about serious annoyances by bites of Philidris sp.1 during harvest and pruning. Philidris sp.1 aggressively expelled other ant species from the observation plates and successfully defended the baits against other ants. During the whole study we observed no intraspecific aggression of ants of different Philidris colonies. This is the first time an ant species ofthe genus Philidris is reported to be such an ecologically dominant and abundant part of the ant fauna of a region. The occurrence of Philidris sp.1 was the most important factor determining ant diversity.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Wielgoss et al_2010,2010,"Wielgoss A, Tscharntke T, Buchori D, Fiala B, Clough Y. 2010.

Ant densities in flowers were high and floral nectar was excessively exploited, which may lead to a re- duced visitation rate of pollinators. However, the ants’ presence on flowers strongly reduced flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth Stenoptilodes littoralis and thus decreased the loss of flowers and buds. This is, to our knowledge, the first documented mutualism between invasive ants and an endemic plant species in Hawai‘i.....

Denuded zones (discs) around the mounds in the pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine sites represented 1.2% and 1.0% of the total surface area and reduced plant cover 0.35% and 0.49%, respectively. Vegetation near the perimeter of the cleared discs had decreased species richness and lowered percent cover compared with adjacent reference areas (sampled 3.0 m from discs). Comparisons of plant species occurrences around the discs revealed that (1) most species, including dominant understory plants, were evenly dispersed in relation to nest discs; (2) two species-one in each site-were significantly associated with areas near discs; and (3) six species-four in the pinyon-juniper site and two in the ponderosa pine site-were significantly associated with reference areas.

Mound soils at both sites had elevated concentrations of NO3, P and K, increased conductivity and lower water content compared with disc and reference soils. Disc soils in both sites had lower organic matter content but were otherwise similar to reference soils.

Using paired control and treatment branches from which we excluded ants and other non-volant predators, we found that effects of Argentine ants on the herbivore community were generally similar to those of P. imparis . Argentine ants and P. imparis suppressed the damage by skeletonising insects by 50%, but had little effect on most other external-feeding or internal-feeding guilds. 3. The abundance of aphids was 100% greater in the presence of Argentine ants, but there was no effect on aphid numbers in the presence of P. imparis . Late season aphid numbers were substantially higher in the presence of Argentine ants, but not P. imparis . 4. The effects of Argentine ants on skeletonising insects and aphids combined with the overwhelming abundance of Argentine ant workers, suggests that they may have substantial, but often overlooked, effects on the herbivore communities on other plant species in or near riparian habitats in which they invade..... Of the six feeding guilds we examined, only aphids demon- strated effects due to the Argentine ants, and that effect was an increase in abundance. Two additional guilds showed evidence of suppression by both native and Argentine ants: leaf damage by skeletonising insects was reduced by 50%, but there was no significant difference in the extent of suppression by native and Argentine ants.

This changes the hydraulic characteristics of the system, causing, a reduction of water pressure resulting to an uneven water distribution. If the problem is not corrected, it could result, in heavy yield losses in some parts of the field due to poor plant growth caused by severe water shortage. With an increasing number of fields converted to drip irrigation in Hawaii, the problem of ant damage to drip tubes becomes a serious threat to the well-being of the industry.

Hatchling survival from eggs incubated in a lab setting in the presence of Red Fire Ants decreased by approximately 10% compared to nests without ants. In a second experiment performed in the wild, the presence of Red Fire Ant resulted in a 43% reduction in nest success including direct (14.5%) and indirect (28.5%) effects. Our study confirmed that Red Fire Ants negatively affect C. latirostris nest success, directly because Red Fire Ants attack and cause the hatchling’s death after pipping and indirectly by preventing females from caring for eggs, providing hatching assistance, and maintaining nests.... For all years combined, hatchling survival was approximately 10% less in the presence of Red Fire Ants (mean = 0.88 6 0.20 SD, n = 13 nests) compared to without ants (mean = 1.00 6 0SD, n =13 nests), (H = 4, P = 0.0068)....

To address this problem, we compare the effects of red imported Þre ant on the ßowering and fruiting of self-pollinating and cross-pollinating crops by Þeld investigations and indoor experiments. In the Þeld, our results revealed that regardless of the aphid interaction, red imported Þre ant preferred ßowering mungbean plants, and their activities decreased the yields of single plants, total pod number, kernel number, and kernel weight. The interaction of red imported Þre ant and aphids generated unfavorable effects on rapeseed yields per plant, total pod number, grain number, grain weight, and thousand-kernel weight and stimulated an elevated proportion of malformed seeds. However, the differences were not signiÞcant if only red imported Þre ant was present. In the laboratory, although red imported Þre ant display no apparent preference toward the seedlings ofmungbean or rapeseed, the ants clearly favor the ßowering plants ofmungbeans.

Plants protected from weevils had less floral damage and higher fruit set than those accessible to weevils. The more abundant ants were on inflorescences, the less accessible fruits were to weevils, resulting in reduced fruit loss from larval infections. Ants did not exclude weevils, but they affected weevil activity. Native herbivores generally provide some biotic resistance to plant invasions yet Spathoglottis plicata remains an aggressive colonizer despite the acquisition of a herbivore/seed predator partly because invasive ants attracted to extrafloral nectaries inhibited weevil behavior. Thus, the invasion of one species facilitates the success of another as in invasional meltdowns....Behavioral observations of weevils on ant-free inflo- rescences versus ant-occupied inflorescences revealed that the mean proportion of time spent on active behavior was lower on inflorescences with ants (0.36, SD = 0.41) than those inflorescences without them (0.70, SD = 0.33). Comparison of the medians revealed that this difference between groups was significant (Mann–Whitney U-test, W = 672, p = 0.002). Again, the mean number of weevils per inflorescence was similar when ants were either present (2.10, SD = 0.94) or absent (2.34, SD = 1.18), and comparison of the medians con- firmed that the groups were not significantly different (Mann–Whitney U-test, W = 503.5, p = 0.557).

Both nestling and hatchling survival were greater in enclosures with reduced Fire Ants. Additionally, hatchlings exposed to ambient Fire Ant levels moved farther, used more locations, and had larger 6-mo home ranges than hatchlings exposed to reduced Fire Ant levels. Our study suggests Fire Ants may be a major source of Gopher Tortoise predation and have indirect effects on hatchling behavior, but further studies are needed to determine whether Fire Ants are having population-level impacts..... Of the 32 Gopher Tortoise hatchlings monitored, 11 (34.4%) did not survive the 6-mo study period.... Five individuals (15.6%) were depredated by Fire Ants in ambient Fire Ant enclosures; six (18.8%) were depredated by Raccoons..... Because we did not include hatchlings depredated by Raccoons (n = 6) in the hatchling survival analysis, hatchling survival was 50% in ambient ant enclosures compared to 100% at reduced ant enclosures (Fig. 2);  survival differed between ant treatments (?2= 11.28, df = 1, P < 0.001), but not between vertebrate predator treatments (?2= 0.18, df = 1, P = 0.668).... Parameter estimates examining the effect of ant treatment across the metrics of number of locations, home range, distance moved, and maximum dispersal contain negative parameter estimates, indi- cating hatchlings moved less frequently and shorter distances when exposed to reduced levels of Fire Ants than ambient Fire Ant levels (Fig. 3, Table 3).",3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Dziazio et al_2016,2016,"Dziadzio MC, Chandler RB, Smith LL, Castleberry SB. 2016.

626,76,Solenopsis invicta,United States,Florida,,,,,,,"1. The fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is a globally distributed invasive ant that is largely restricted to disturbed habitats in its introduced range. For more than half a century, biologists have believed its success results from superior competitive abilities relative to native ant species, as well as an escape from their natural enemies. 2. We used large volumes of hot water to kill fire ant colonies, and only fire ant colonies, on experimental plots in pastures, and found that populations and diversity of co-occurring ants did not subsequently increase. 3. These results are contrary to classical predictions and indicate that S. invicta is not a superior competitor that suppresses native ants, and that the low diversity and abun- dance of native ants in degraded ecosystems does not result from interaction with fire ants. Instead, other factors such as prior disturbance and recruitment limitation may be the primary limiting factors for native species in these habitats.... At no level did S. invicta competitively suppress co- occurring ants. If competitive interactions are shaping this ant community, effects should depend upon popula- tion densities, but removing S. invicta had no significant effect on either the abundance (Fig. 1) or species richness (Fig. 3) of co-occurring ant species over 2 years. In treat- ment plots, the abundance of S. invicta was actually lower (Fig. 1a) than the abundance of co-occurring ants (Fig. 1b). This low level is particularly important because population size can be important in determining the outcome of competitive interactions, particularly exploitative competition..... A species-by-species analysis also shows that greatly reducing the density of S. invicta had no impact on the ant fauna. No co-occurring species, whether introduced or native, changed significantly in abundance following reduction of the density of S. invicta over 2 years (Table 1).... Excluding S. invicta, six introduced species accounted for 89% of the total abundance of ants. Native species comprised a small minority (11%) of the total abundance of ants but accounted for a majority of the species (74%).",0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,REVIEWED (Lessard et al_2009) Invasive ants alter the phylogenetic structure of ant communities,King & Tschinkel_2006,2006,"King JR, Tschinkel WR. 2006.

Using a paired experimental design, we compared patterns of foraging and rates of provisioning for breeding eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) in unmanipulated (control) territories to those in adjacent (treated) territories where fire ants were experimentally reduced. Bluebirds inhabiting treated territories foraged nearer their nests and provisioned offspring more frequently than bluebirds inhabiting control territories with unmanipulated fire ant levels. Additionally, nestlings from treated territories were in better condition than those from control territories, though these differences were largely confined to early development. The elimination of significant differences in body condition towards the end of the nestling period suggests that bluebird parents in control territories were able to make up the food deficit caused by fire ants, potentially by working harder to adequately provision their offspring.",0,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,,,Ligon et al_2012,2012,"Ligon RA, Siefferman L, Hill GE. 2012.

Sea turtle hatchlings of two species (Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas) exposed to fire ants during incubation and emergence were collected on Juno Beach, Florida. Hatchlings were maintained for ten days in a common saltwater outdoor pool at the Marinelife Center, Juno Beach. Hatchlings showing pustules diagnostic of S. invicta stings were compared to non-stung controls in terms of survival, growth (mass and SCL) and initial crawling strength.

We demonstrate that fire ant presence significantly explains patterns of lizard survival among populations and over small spatial scales within populations. As a consequence of survival patterns or avoidance behavior, lizard habitat use was significantly altered in the presence of fire ants in high density. Finally, we found strong signatures of natural selection on lizard body size and body condition, but the patterns of selection did not appear to be influenced by variation in fire ant density. This study highlights the direct influence of predatory fire ants on hatchling lizard mortality and habitat use. These effects can have important demographic and population-level consequences....

From 1974 through 1981, red imported fire ants were seldom seen in or near the cement drainage culverts used by the cliff swallows. The number of active culverts varied, but we averaged approximately 200 breeding pairs of swallows each year. In 1980, fire ants partially destroyed one colony, but incomplete records prevented us from quantifying the data. However, in 1982, we began to see red imported fire ants in the swallow nests. One culvert of three had 13 of 21 nests destroyed by ants. In 1983 and 1984, we started putting out AMDRO® to try to lessen effects that the ants can have on swallows. It helped reduce the ant attacks in most cases, enough so that most adults could raise young. Red imported fire ants were present in the vicinity of most active culverts, but they were not considered a problem unless more than 20-25% of the nests were affected. In spite of our efforts, red imported fire ants invaded many nests, especially those of late or renesting swallows. Two of four active culverts in 1983, and one of five active culverts in 1984, were invaded by red imported fire ants. A total of 212 of 357 nests were observed with ants in the nests actively devouring young or entering pipped eggs. We compared nesting success from 1982 through 1984 of cliff swallows in culverts without fire ants to those with fire ants (Table 1). Normal nesting success was 74.9%. When fire ants were a problem, nesting success dropped to 40.5%, a 34.4% decrease in nesting success. Red imported fire ants appeared to be most damaging from hatching to the time swallows develop feather tracts (7-10 days). During this time we saw ants enter pipped eggs as well as swarm over newly hatched nestlings, biting and stinging them to death. Within two days, no evidence remained of nestlings ever having been in the nests.

This shift from ground to foliar foraging resulted in more frequent interactions between fire ants and arthropods associated with cotton. The survival of herbivores (caterpillars) and predators (ladybird beetles and lacewings) was lower in the presence of fire ants and aphids compared with fire ants alone in greenhouse experiments. Similarly, fire ants and aphids deterred plant bugs from spending time on cotton foliage. Using large-scale field manipulations of fire ants along with naturally oc- curring aphid populations, we found that the ant–aphid mutualism accounted for much of the variation underlying ant impact on cotton herbivores and predators. For example, in 2001, ?27% of herbivore taxa and 54% of predator taxa were adversely affected by the mutualism. The overall community response, however, was highly conditional with strong temporal variation in the effects of the ant–aphid association. Our results indicate that the relationship between fire ants and aphids serves as a key interaction that alters the structure of cotton arthropod communities.....

and aphids than on plants with fire ants alone (Fig. 2A; F2, 236 ? 40.87, P ? 0.0001); this effect was intensified with increasing aphid density.

In a similar greenhouse experiment, aphids did not affect tarnished plant bug survival in the presence of fire ants (G ? 0.38, df ? 2, P ? 0.05). Fire ants did, however, discourage tarnished plant bugs from spend- ing time, and subsequently feeding, on cotton plants (Fig. 2B; F2,44 ? 3.22, P ? 0.05).

730,180,Solenopsis invicta,United States,Texas,,,,,,,"It is quite likely that S. invicta did contribute directly or indirectly to the disappearance or reduction in number of some species. For example, Pheidole lamia was sampled by Porter and Savignano (1990) in both pitfalls and at baits, but was not found in 1999. Both T. bicarinatum and P. lamia are fairly common elsewhere in the Austin area, however, and have not been regionally excluded by S. invicta. Overall, a comparison of species lists before and after the S. invicta invasion reveals no strong evidence that S. invicta has completely excluded many ant species from BFL. The 50% decrease in ant species richness extrapolated from the initial trajectory of the invasion has certainly not materialized (see also Wojcik 1994). One species that has definitely decreased in abundance as a result of the S. invicta invasion is its congener S. geminata. As S. invicta spread across BFL, it competitively replaced S. geminata (Porter et al. 1988). The exclusion of S. geminata by S. invicta has continued in a similar manner as that documented in the initial stages of the invasion, and in 1999 S. geminata was present at BFL in only one isolated area containing ?12 colonies. The harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, was also documented to be aggressively attacked by S. invicta, and many colonies of P. barbatus were eradicated in the early stages of the invasion (Hook and Porter 1990). Like S. geminata, however, harvester ants were still present at BFL in 1999, although were not common.",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Morrison_2002a,2002,"Morrison LW. 2002.

Working in northeastern Georgia (USA), an area characterized by a rich ant-dispersed flora, fragmented forests, and invasions by the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, I monitored the interactions between ants and S. canadensis seeds in uninvaded forest interiors, uninvaded forest edges, invaded forest interiors, and invaded forest edges. I observed 95% of the seed dispersal events that occurred within the 60-min observation intervals. Seed collection rates were similar among all four (habitat x invasion) groups. The presence of invasive ants had a strong effect on seed dispersal distance: S. invicta collected most seeds in invaded sites, but was a poorer disperser than four of five native ant taxa. Habitat type (interior versus edge) had no effect on seed dispersal distance, but it had a strong effect on seed dispersal direction. Dispersal towards the edge was disproportionately rare in uninvaded forest edges, and ants in those habitats moved the average dispersed seed approximately 70 cm away from that edge. Dispersal direction was also skewed away from the edge in uninvaded forest interiors and invaded forest edges, albeit non-significantly. This biased dispersal may help explain the rarity of myrmecochorous plants in younger forests and edges, and their poor ability to disperse between fragments. This is the first demonstration that forest edges and S. invicta invasion influence seed dispersal destination and distance, respectively.

Fire ant sexuals fly long distances on their mating flights and are a major food source for arthropod and vertebrate predators and may thus transfer mercury through food webs... The high mercury content in fire ants may result from feeding at higher trophic levels than other species. Alter- natively, they may feed more heavily on aquatic food sources.... Fire ant sexuals are a major food source for invertebrate and avian predators (Whitcomb et al. 1973), and even in relatively dry climates can make up over half of the prey items and a quarter of prey biomass eaten by devel- oping Purple Martins (Helms et al. 2016a, b).

817,267,Solenopsis invicta,Peru,Antamina,,,,"Presence of ants in all fish stomachs indicates a simple mechanism to explain the mortality patterns. Ingestion of fire ants by fish would release the venom that is composed of formic acid, alkaloids, and proteins (that collectively act as general toxins on fish). The inference is that the large trout were killed by the ingestion of fire ants, as dominant fish would be more likely to feed on surface insects than smaller trout or catfish. Since the fish kill events occurred after the rain storms, it is highly probable that flooding of localized ant colonies on the banks of the river resulted in large numbers of ants entering the stream... Swarming of the winged form of fire ants has resulted in a number of fish kills in the southeastern United States where the fire ant has become established after being introduced in the 1930s. Fish that ingest small quantities (e.g., one or two) of ants generally recover (e.g., Fontenot ., 1999). Others have speculated the ants that are still alive when consumed may actually sting the animal in their stomachs and this leads to death if the number of stings is excessive (Allen It is likely the consumption of dead ants by fish also releases the venom without stings. In 1986, the Department of Environment Quality in Louisiana documented a fish kill of sunfish (Lepomis spp.) was due to formic acid poisoning from ingestion of fire ants (St. Pe 1994). In 1998, there was a major fish kill in the Guadalupe River where Texas officials estimated that 22,000 trout were killed over a 25 km stretch of river due to ingestion of fire ants (Conteras 1999).",2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Eakins et al_2006,2006,"Eakins RJ, Fitzgerald DG, Burt AJ, Farara DG, Tello G. 2006.

Horned Lizard and in addition, a prey model involving interaction between the Texas Horned Lizard's main food source, harvester ants, and the non-native fire ant. The goal of this work is to understand the population dynamics of the Texas Horned Lizard, the horned lizard's relationship with its prey, and the effects of fire ants on the biological complexity of this population..... Two models are developed to understand the population dynamics of the Texas Horned Lizard. The RIFA-Harvester Ant model is deterministic in nature and dis- crete in time and calculates colony growth for both RIFA and harvester ants. Several considerations were made including dormancy and reproduction periods, habitat de- struction, and the number of contacts made between RIF.A and harvester ants. The RIFA-Harvester Ant model is coupled with the model on Texas Horned Lizards to understand the dependence of horned lizards on harvester ants..... Texas Horned Lizards in this model were capable of establishing an equilibrium between growth, starvation (inactivity of colonies), predation, and winter survivor- ship. This equilibrium was slightly greater than the 6:1 ratio assumed for harvester ant colonies versus horned lizards. This implies that horned lizards are capable of exploiting their prey to the point of inactivity while still maintaning a sustanable population. The model presented several different population behaviors, but the assumption was made that populations in the wild were stable. This assumption fol- lowed closelv with most available literature as the model estimates were verv similiar to those seen in nature",2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,0,2,,,Fagan_2000,2000,"Fagan JF. 2000.

We conducted behavioral trials in a Y-maze that had crushed fire ants in one arm, and examined correlations between rodent and fire ant densities in the field. Baiomys taylori significantly avoided (71% of trials) the arm of the maze containing fire ants. Sigmodon hispidus and P. leucopus were indifferent to the presence of fire ants in the Y-maze. Peromyscus leucopus also selected refuge sites that were no further from fire ant mounds than expected based on chance. We observed no significant relationships between rodent and fire ant densities on live trapping transects. On the trapping grid, the results were dependent on the level of scale analyzed. At the 400 m2 scale level, there were significantly fewer fire ant mounds surrounding trap stations where B. taylori was captured.

We analyzed nests harvested during five consecutive nesting seasons of C. latirostris to determine the phenology of S. invicta colonization of caiman nests. The percentages of colonized caiman nests for each season were calculated. Densities of S. invicta mounds built on bare ground were assessed to determine potential relationships between density and the proportion of caiman nests colonized by the end of nesting season.

In this study, we compared the competitive ability of the invasive ant S. invicta and its co-occurring species T. melanoceph- alum in the laboratory. We also determined whether the two ant species could coexist and share honeydew resource. Our results indicate that the foraging activity of T. melanocephalum was restrained by S. invicta. Mortality of S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was significantly higher in T. melanocephalum colony case than that in other cases. The invasive ability between the two ant species was significantly different. These results suggest that S. invicta suppresses exploitation of honeydew-producing hemipter- ans by native ants and occupies most of honeydew resource. S. invicta could not completely drive T. mela- nocephalum out of honeydew competition, with small numbers of T. melanocephalum workers coexisting and sharing the honeydew with S. invicta.

Solenopsis invicta occurred significantly more often at burrows within 30 m of the greenway's outer edge than at burrows in more interior parts of the greenway (57% versus 16%). Among the interior burrows, S. invicta occurred significantly more often at burrows di- rectly on two narrow strips of disturbed habitat, along an old fence line and an old pipeline, than at burrows not on these two strips (46% versus 12%). The greenway interior appears to offer tortoises and other species some refuge from S. invicta. However, the long thin design typical of greenways, the inclusion of walking paths through the greenways, and the policies of prescribed burning and reduction mowing used to maintain open habitat for the tortoises all may increase the tortoises' exposure to S. invicta.

S. invicta can replace the role of native ants in mutualisms between ants and honeydew-producing Hemiptera, which results in loss of important food resources for native ants and natural enemies of hemipterans. Further research is required to assess the complex ecosystem-level impacts of S. invicta in introduced areas..... Field studies show that S. invicta also impacts the number and species richness of flower-visiting insects, including rapeseed (Brassica napus) where seed yield was reduced (Wu et al. 2015, 2016). In addition, the number of flea beetles (Phyllotreta striolata) was reduced by 59.4 and 43.5% in S. invicta-only plots and S. invicta-aphids plots, respectively. The interaction between S. invicta and aphids also decreased the abundance of two hoverflies, Eristalinus quinquestriatus and E. quinquelineatus, by 39.4% (Wu et al. 2016). Studies have shown that S. invicta does not significantly impact the pollination efficiency of Apis cerana, a key pollinator of B. napus, where no changes in visit frequency or duration were observed (Wu 2014). However, visit duration of Pieris rapae, another key pollinator of B. napus, was reduced by 29.5 and 22.4% in S. invicta-only plots and S. invicta-aphid plots, respectively.",4,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,REVIEW (Wang et al_2019),Wang et al_2019,2019,"Wang L, Xu Y juan, Zeng L, Lu Y yue. 2019.

Horned Lizard and in addition, a prey model involving interaction between the Texas Horned Lizard's main food source, harvester ants, and the non-native fire ant. The goal of this work is to understand the population dynamics of the Texas Horned Lizard, the horned lizard's relationship with its prey, and the effects of fire ants on the biological complexity of this population..... Two models are developed to understand the population dynamics of the Texas Horned Lizard. The RIFA-Harvester Ant model is deterministic in nature and dis- crete in time and calculates colony growth for both RIFA and harvester ants. Several considerations were made including dormancy and reproduction periods, habitat de- struction, and the number of contacts made between RIF.A and harvester ants. The RIFA-Harvester Ant model is coupled with the model on Texas Horned Lizards to understand the dependence of horned lizards on harvester ants..... Analysis showed that in the presence of fire ants, harvester ants become extinct within several years of the initial infestation. Fire ants reached a maximum density in twice the time it took for this extinction to occur. Time until extinction had a greater dependence on initial infestation densities (high or low infestation) and less so on the initial densities of harvester ants. The model was restricted to the case where 0 < H{t) < Ki{t) and the assumption that harvester ants do not affect fire ant growth was also considered.",4,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Fagan_2000,2000,"Fagan JF. 2000.

Fortunately, 0. r. reses has been introduced elsewhere and further reintroductions are currently planned. Before these reintroductions are implemented, it is important to try and determine which factors were most likely to have caused the decline and extinction. While habitat destruction was prob- ably the ultimate reason why there were so few tree snails, it is likely that an interaction of habitat frag- mentation and the invasion of an exotic predator caused the final decline that lead to the extinction in 1992. We examined the last 93 0. r. reses shells to infer cause of death. In addition, using surrogate Florida tree snails, Liguusfasciatus, we conducted experiments on two previously unstudied causes of mortality: predation by red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, and mortality from falls caused by wind. We found that the majority of the last 0. r. reses shells were intact, indicating that mammalian and bird predation were not the greatest causes of mortality. Mortality caused by wind knocking tree snails onto the rocky hammock substrate appeared to be a potential source of mortality, but few of the tree snails exhibited signs of breakage. Mortality from fire ants appears to be one of the most likely causes of the recent decline and extinction of 0. r. reses. Experiments indicated that in a semi-natural enclosure, fire ants were capable of killing all ages of L.fasciatus, even during aestivation. Fire ants are currently found throughout the last known habitat of 0. r. reses and were first discovered in this area at the time of the decline.",5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,0,5,,,Forys et al_2001b,2001,"Forys EA, Quistorff A, Allen CR, Wojcik DP. 2001.

This leads to questions about the role of fire ants as seed dispersers. We examined the fate of ant-dispersed seed in the longleaf pine ecosystem. First, we determined removal rates for a suite of common ground cover species. Then, we verified the final location of removed seeds by using a wax cast to examine nest contents, and locating dyed seeds deposited in trash piles on the ground surface. Finally, we determined if the germination rate of seeds deposited by fire ants was affected by ant dispersion. Fire ants were most attracted to elaiosome-bearing seed and collected nonelaiosome-bearing seed at a much lower rate. No seeds were found in the contents of wax castings of fire ant nest chambers, suggesting that seed is not stored within the nest. Of the dyed seeds that we presented to fire ants, 30–40 % were recollected in surface trash piles in the mound vicinity within 1 week following removal. Undiscovered seeds were considered destroyed or buried in foraging tunnels. A small percentage of the deposited seeds were able to germinate, but there was no difference in the percent germination between seeds manipulated by fire ants and the control. Low germination was likely due to a high percentage of immature seeds used in the study.

Above-ground RIFA foraging intensity was found to be related to disturbance, and high numbers of foraging RIFA were correlated with low numbers of native ants. In-cave RIFA foraging was primarily limited to the entrance and twilight zones of caves with significant RIFA densities on the surface. Occasional foraging in more remote parts of caves occurred in cooler months and RIFA gained access to the cave without using the entrance apparent to humans. RIFA foraging in the entrance and twilight zones resulted in relatively little interaction with cave-limited species, but RIFA co-occurance with important species, especially the cave cricket Ceuthophilus secretus, that utilize both cave and surface habitats indicates that there are important secondary effects which have a negative impact on the cave-limited species of concern. Keystone taxa in the cave community appear to be the cave cricket, Ceuthophilus secretus, and white (cave-adapted) springtails. At baits placed above ground at night, cave crickets often arrived at the food resource before RIFA, but the arrival and subsequent recruitment of workers by RIFA corresponded to the departure, or decline in numbers, of foraging cave crickets, indicating competition for crickets and RIFA for at least some food resources",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Taylor et al_2003,2003,"Taylor SJ, Krejca JK, Smith JE, Block VR, Hutto F. 2003. 2003 Investigation of the potential for red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) impacts on rare karst invertebrates at Fort Hood, Texas: a field study."

For Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina we compared average north- ern bobwhite quail abundance based on Christmas Bird Count data for each county before and after fire ant invasion, and conducted regression analyses on bobwhite quail abundance and year preinvasion, and abundance and year postinvasion. Regionally, northern bobwhite quail were more abundant before (0.067 ± 0.018 bobwhite quail per observer hour) than after fire ants invaded (0.019 ± 0.006; Z ? ?3.746, df ? 18, P < 0.001). There was no significant regional population trend for northern bobwhite quail (r2 ? 0.24; df? 9, P ? 0.13) before fire ant invasion. Post-invasion, northern bobwhite quail popula- tions significantly declined regionally (r2 ? 0.76, df ? 15, P < 0.001), and in Florida (r2 ? 0.71, df? 15, P < 0.01) and South Carolina (r2 ? 0.50, df? 9, P ? 0.01).

The study site is a 1,400 m2 meadow (33.5 by 50 m) located 5 mi south of College Station, Brazos Co., Texas.... Although S. invicta was the most abundant ant in the meadow habitat, our study suggests that a number of native ant species can coexist with this invasive species well after it as become established. In contrast, a study by Porter and Savignano (1990) only 140 km west of our meadow site showed that the initial invasion of S. invicta devastated the native ant fauna. They found that nearly all (99.7%) of more than 22,000 ants in infested sites were S. invicta (Porter and Savignano, 1990). These results differ from ours, where just over 50% of ants were S. invicta. Differences between the 2 studies may be influenced by differences in the habitats samples, sampling procedures, and time since infestation; however, the most important difference may be the form of S. invic- ta present at the 2 study sites.

Hatchling survival from eggs incubated in a lab setting in the presence of Red Fire Ants decreased by approximately 10% compared to nests without ants. In a second experiment performed in the wild, the presence of Red Fire Ant resulted in a 43% reduction in nest success including direct (14.5%) and indirect (28.5%) effects. Our study confirmed that Red Fire Ants negatively affect C. latirostris nest success, directly because Red Fire Ants attack and cause the hatchling’s death after pipping and indirectly by preventing females from caring for eggs, providing hatching assistance, and maintaining nests.... For all years combined, hatchling survival was approximately 10% less in the presence of Red Fire Ants (mean = 0.88 6 0.20 SD, n = 13 nests) compared to without ants (mean = 1.00 6 0SD, n =13 nests), (H = 4, P = 0.0068)....

1082,532,Solenopsis invicta,United States,Georgia,"The services provided within a community can change as the species composition of that community changes. For example, ant–seed dispersal mutualisms can be disrupted in habitats dominated by invasive ants. We propose that this disruption is related to changes in mean ant body size, given that invasive ants are smaller than most native seed-dispersing ants. We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed-dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass. Using a case study, we demonstrate that both the mean body size of seed-collecting ants and seed dispersal distances are decreased in sites invaded by Solenopsis invicta, the im- ported red fire ant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mean size of seed-collecting ants at a seed depot or within a community is a useful predictor of mean seed dispersal distances at those sites. Last, we show that small seed-collecting ants and decreased seed dispersal distances are common features of sites occupied by invasive ants.

1111,561,Solenopsis invicta,United States,Arkansas,,,,,,,"It has been suggested that Red Imported Fire Ants (Solenopsis invicta) [RIFA] negatively influence native ants where it has colonized. Most studies showing these negative effects have followed invasion of new lands as RIFA have increased their range. However, others have suggested that RIFA do not impact native ants that much. Their evidence comes from studies conducted many years after RIFA have colonized an area, and show that native species are at almost pre-infestation levels. Our objective was to identify RIFA influences in space, sampling ant communities concurrently in infested and uninfested areas. To do this, ants were sampled in selected prairies in extreme southern Arkansas where RIFA has been part of the ant community for more than 30 years, and in uninfested prairies in east-central Arkansas where RIFA range expansion is heading.... Ants were sampled using pitfall traps, distributed along 3 20-pitfall traplines per prairie, and collected 3 to 4 times over the summer at about 1-month intervals. Ant species lists by prairie were assembled using the quantitative measure total number of pitfalls that collected a species over the entire summer. This count measured the number of times a species was collected, a measure of relative abundance. To analyze ant communities over all sites, multivariate statistics, specifically hierarchical cluster analysis and indicator species analysis (ISA), were used. Cluster analysis identified the overall differences in prairie communities and ISA identified specific species significantly affected by prairie location. Cluster analysis classified the infested and uninfested prairies into 2 distinct groups; showing that location was important. Of course, it is surmised that RIFA induced this location effect. In fact, RIFA was one of 3 species identified by ISA as being significantly affected by prairie location. RIFA was absent from the east-central prairies, but it made up more than 78% of the ant community on each of the 3 infested prairies. The other significantly affected species were Pheidole dentata and Temnothorax pergandei, both absent in RIFA infested prairies. Pheidole dentata was the dominant ant in the east-central uninfested prairies. So, RIFA seem to affect individual species rather than the entire community as a whole.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Thompson & General_2010,2010,"Thompson LC, General DM. 2010.

We also created experimental dyads of adjacent territories comprised of one territory with artificially reduced fire ant abundance (treated) and one territory that was unmanipulated (control). We found that more bluebird young fledged from treated territories than from adjacent control territories. Fire ant abundance also explained significant variation in two measures of reproductive success across the study population: number of fledglings and hatching success of second clutches. Furthermore, the likelihood of bluebird parents re-nesting in the same territory was negatively influenced by the abundance of foraging fire ants, and parents nesting in territories with experimentally reduced abundances of fire ants produced male-biased broods relative to pairs in adjacent control territories..... Bluebird pairs inhabiting treated territories did not fledge significantly more offspring (x¯ = 3.960.4) than pairs in control territories (x¯ = 3.060.4) during the first breeding attempt of the season (paired t-test, n = 15, t= 1.60, p = 0.13).

However, within dyads, the cumulative fledging success (total number of offspring fledged from a given territory) was significantly different between control and experimental territories. Specifically, when we analyzed the total number of offspring fledged from each territory (regardless of parent identity and excluding nests that experienced predation), we found that treated territories fledged 1.1 more offspring (x¯ =6.360.5) than adjacent control territories (x¯ = 5.260.5; paired t-test, n = 15, t= 2.17, p,0.05). This last statistic compares the productivity of territories rather than individuals and takes into account the territories where no second nest was attempted (4/15 control territories and 5/15 treated territories).",1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,multiple impacts?,Ligon et al_2011,2011,"Ligon RA, Siefferman L, Hill GE. 2011.

1189,639,Solenopsis invicta,,,,,,,,,"Invasive species displace native species and potentially alter the structure and function of ecological communities. In this study, we compared the generic composition of intact and invaded ant communities from 12 published studies and found that invasive ant species alter the phylogenetic structure of native ant communities. Intact ant communities were phylogenetically evenly dispersed, suggesting that competition structures communities. However, in the presence of an invasive ant species, these same communities were phylo- genetically clustered. Phylogenetic clustering in invaded communities suggests that invasive species may act as strong environmental filters and prune the phylogenetic tree of native species in a nonrandom manner, such that only a few closely related taxa can persist in the face of a biological invasion. Taxa that were displaced by invasive ant species were evenly dispersed in the phylogeny, suggesting that diversity losses from invasive ant species are not clustered in particular lineages. Collectively, these results suggest that there is strong phylogenetic structuring in intact native ant communities, but the spread of invasive species disassembles those communities above and beyond the effect of simple reductions in diversity..... We compiled data on the composition of ant communities by searching Web of Science and Google Scholar using the key words ants, invasive, invasion, community, richness, diversity, and structure on 30 November 2007. From this search we selected studies that (1) explicitly compared invaded and un-invaded (i.e., ‘‘intact’’) communities, and (2) used standardized, quantitative sampling methods (Longino and Colwell 1997) to quantify ant community structure in both the invaded and intact sites. Only 12 studies met those criteria (Appendix A).",3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,REVIEW,Lessard et al_2009,2009,"Lessard J-P, Fordyce JA, Gotelli NJ, Sanders NJ. 2009.

Many of these species are thought to be limited by host plant rarity, but also by predation on immature stages by invasive ants. We tested the latter hypothesis with a field experiment involving Drosophila crucigera, a more common surrogate for sympatric endangered species, and the invasive ant Solenopsis papuana, on the island of O?ahu. We established ant suppression and control plots across three forest sites. Within each plot we placed a host plant branch piece, into which lab-reared flies had oviposited, and subsequently tracked weekly emergence of adults. Numbers of flies that emerged were 2.4 times higher in ant-suppressed plots than in control plots; this 58% reduction in survival from egg to adult in the presence of ants was similar across all three sites. Among plots, numbers of emerged flies exhibited a pattern suggesting that the detrimental effect of ants is density dependent.... Higher numbers of flies emerged in the ant-suppressed plots compared to the control plots at all three sites, even at Pahole where fewer flies emerged overall (Fig. 3, left panel). Across all plots, the treatment factor contributed significantly to variation in emerged fly numbers (GLM, Wald ?2 = 6.38, p = 0.012)",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,"Experimental paper quantifying impact on model species (lowering confidence, scale?)

684,134,Solenopsis richteri,Argentina,Mar Chiquita,,,,"Polychaetes in soft-bottom intertidal habitats of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (38° 00’ S, 57° 30’W, Argentina) are the prey of shorebirds, fishes and crabs. Based on 3 yr of field sampling, we observed that the fire ant Solenopsis richteri is another important predator of poly- chaetes (mostly Laeonereis acuta) during the summer (December to March). Ants use intertidal areas adjacent to terrestrial habitats which have well-developed soils and are characterized by inland veg- etation (i.e. pampas grasses), but appear to be excluded from habitats with the burrowing crab Chas- magnathus granulata. Ants build intertidal galleries perpendicular to the shoreline that are used to transport polychaetes to the nest. The ants attacked the polychaetes in burrows with diameters larger than their own abdomen. They selected larger polychaete sizes, attacking up to 66% of the poly- chaetes in the high intertidal. Based on our observations, and given the wide range of this species and related fire ants, we believe that this terrestrial-marine interaction between fire ants and polychaetes could be a common phenomenon.....Ant predation rates varied among days (1-way ANOVA test, F17 = 13.15, p < 0.001, Fig. 4). The maxi- mum percentage of attacked burrows was 66.7% on 20 of February 2001, a minimum of 1.8% on 24 of February and 0% on months and days without ant ac- tivity (Fig. 4). One ant gallery attacked up to 70.4 (SD = 81.28) burrows m–2 tide–1.... This study shows that the fire ant Solenopsis richteri is an important episodic intertidal predator at our study site, since ants are consistently found preying on poly- chaetes during the summer.

Soil P, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and S (all macronutrients), as well as Na+ concen- trations from ant mound soils were substantially elevated during the late Autumn to Winter transition compared to control soil locations, whereas Fe2+ and Mn2+ levels (both micronutrients) were significantly lower in ant mound soils versus control soil environments.""",0,2,NI,0,NI,NI,0,NI,NI,0,NI,NI,0,NI,,NI,0,NI,0,0,0,"Paper details impact of fire ants on turf grass soil, but does not indicate if these differences are positive, negative or neutral",,DeFauw et al_2008,2008,"DeFauw SL, Vogt JT, Boykin DL. 2008.

Mounds were typically higher in clay, P, and K, and lower in organic matter and S than the adjacent soils. Replicated studies on an Ultisol and an Alfisol confirmed the significance («=0.05) of these effects in most cases. Effects on Ca were strongly dependent on the characteristics of the initial soil.

From these, we observed a sample of partial nest pre- dation events (n ? 47). Partial predation events resulted in three outcomes: (1) The nest failed due to parental abandonment; (2) adult stayed with the nest, but clutch failed to hatch, usually due to further predation events; or (3) adult stayed with nest and the remaining eggs hatched, add- ing to the reproductive fitness of the adult. Most common predators causing partial depredations were ratsnakes (Pantherophis alleghaniensis and P. guttatus), kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), and fire ants (Solenopsis spp.).",1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1,,,Ellis-Felege et al_2012,2012,"Ellis-Felege SN, Miller A, Burnam JS, Wellendorf SD, Sisson DC, Palmer WE, Carroll JP. 2012.

Arboreal pitfall traps were used to compare the ant faunas of a central Texas forest in the process of invasion by Solenopsis wagneri, the imported red fire ant. In the uninfested forest patch, 12 of 14 trees yielded ants in the tree canopy, ca. 10-m off the ground, compared to 3 of 13 trees in the infested patch. Ant diversity per trap-tree correspondingly dropped from 1.4 to 0.3 species/tree.

Twenty per cent of all species (60 plants and 220 pollinators) in the pooled network were aliens, being involved in 38 per cent of the interactions. Most aliens were insects, especially dipterans (36%), hymenopterans (30%) and lepidopterans (14%). These alien insects had more links than either endemic pollinators or non-endemic natives, some even acting as island hubs. Aliens linked mostly to generalized species, increasing nestedness and thus network stability. Moreover, they infiltrated all seven connected modules (determined by geo- graphical and phylogenetic constraints) of the overall network, representing around 30 per cent of species in two of them. An astonishingly high pro- portion (38%) of connectors, which enhance network cohesiveness, was also alien. Results indicate that the structure of these emergent novel communities might become more resistant to certain type of disturbances (e.g. species loss), while being more vulnerable to others (e.g. spread of a disease).

We collected a total of 49 species, 13 of which were exotic. Only five sites were free of exotic species, and these were all rainforest. The five most abundant exotic species differed in their habitat association, with Pheidole megacephala associated with rainforests, Brachymyrmex cf. obscurior with savanna, and Wasmannia auropunctata and Nylanderia vaga present in most habitats. Anoplolepis gracilipes occurred primarily in maquis-shrubland, which contrasts with its rainforest affinity elsewhere. Multivariate analysis of overall ant species composition showed strong differentiation of sites according to the distribution of exotic species, and these patterns were maintained at the genus and functional group levels. Native ant composition differed at invaded versus uninvaded rainforest sites, in the absence of differences in habitat variables. Generalised Myrmicinae and Forest Opportunists were particularly affected by invasion.... When excluding exotic species and considering rainforest sites only (n = 23), we found a significant difference in community composition between sites that belonged to the ‘pristine’ group (Group 1) and sites that were dominated by exotic species in the previous analysis (Groups 2 and 3). This was true at the species (ANOSIM global R = 0.53, P<0.01; Fig. 6), genus (ANOSIM global R = 0.70, P<0.001) and functional group (ANOSIM global R = 0.71, P<0.001) levels, and was independent of the substrate type (ANOSIM P>0.05 in all cases). The RELATE procedure revealed no significant relationship between the similarity matrices of ant community composition and of habitat variables (? = 0.07; P = 0.26).

Second, we examined native ant diversity along successional gradients from human-derived savanna to natural rainforest in the long-term absence of fire, where there was a disconnection between disturbance- mediated variation in microhabitat and the abundance of the disturbance specialist Wasmannia. All native ant diversity responses (total abundance, richness, species composition, functional group richness and the abundance of Forest Opportunists) declined indepen- dently of microhabitat variables but in direct associ- ation with high Wasmannia abundance. Our results indicate that invasive ants are acting as back-seat drivers of biodiversity decline in New Caledonia, with invasion facilitated by disturbance but then causing further biodiversity decline.... At Aoupinie´ we collected 54 species (4 of which were introduced) from 21 genera, with the richest being Pheidole (8 species), Monomorium (7), Camponotus (6), Paraparatrechina (5), Rhytidoponera (5) and Lordomyrma (4; ‘‘Appendix 2’’)....  At T1, all native ant responses (native species richness and abundance, functional group richness and Forest Opportunist abundance) declined abruptly between 80 and 70 m from the forest edge to reach a minimum value at 40 m from the edge and remaining stable afterwards (Fig. 7). This trend was closely related (inversely) to Wasmannia abundance (Fig. 7), but not related to any of the measured microhabitat variables. Indeed, Wasmannia abundance was the single best variable explaining all four native ant responses: native species richness (estimate (±SE): -0.19 (±0.04); F1.15 = 21.1; P\0.001; adjusted R2 = 0.56), native species abundance (-0.25 (±0.06); F1.15 = 21; P\0.001; adjusted R2 = 0.56), functional group richness (-0.06 (±0.02); F1.15 = 11; P\0.01; adjusted R2 = 0.38) and Forest Opportunist abundance (-0.26 (±0.07); F1.15 = 15; P\0.01; adjusted R2 = 0.46)..... In all four of our transects, Wasmannia abundance explained patterns of native ant diversity better than did any of the abiotic variables commonly used to assess edge-induced disturbances. This was true for all four independent ant biodiversity responses: native ant richness, native ant abundance, functional group richness and Forest Opportunists abundance. Our results therefore support the perception that Wasmannia invasion has a direct impact on native diversity.... epigaeic species of Leptomyrmex and Rhytidoponera were poorly represented in secondary forest....",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Berman et al_2013a,2013,"Berman M, Andersen AN, Ibanez T. 2013.

726,176,Wasmannia auropunctata,New Caledonia,New Caledonia,,,,,,,"For the last 30 years, Wasmannia auropunctata (the little fire ant) has spread throughout the Pacific and represents a severe threat to fragile island habitats. This invader has often been described as a disturbance specialist. Here we present data on its spread in a dense native rainforest in New Caledonia. We monitored by pitfall trapping the litter ant fauna along an invasive gradient from the edge to the inner forest in July 1999 and March 2000. When W. auropunctata was present, the abundance and richness of native ants drops dramatically. In invaded plots, W. auropunctata represented more than 92% of all trapped ant fauna. Among the 23 native species described, only four cryptic species survived. Wasmannia auropunctata appears to be a highly competitive ant that dominates the litter by eliminating native ants. Mechanisms involved in this invasive success may include predation as well as competitive interactions (exploitation and interference). The invasive success of W. auropunctata is similar to that of other tramp ants and reinforces the idea of common evolutionary traits leading to higher competitiveness in a new environment.... A total of 24 ant species or morphospecies from 14 genera were recorded during the study (Table 1). Wasmannia auropunctata was the only introduced species, the others were native or endemic species. The richest subfamily was Myrmicinae (16 species), followed by Ponerinae (five species), Formicinae (two species) and Dolichoderinae (one species). The richest genus was Lordomyrma (five species). As Pheidole spp. constituted nearly one-half of the native foragers trapped over the two sampling periods (Table 1), they were numerically dominant in the native ant community. The abundance and richness of the native ant species was consistently higher in the non-invaded zones (Fig. 1). In invaded plots, W. auropunctata represented quantitatively more than 92 and 96%, respectively, of the entire ant fauna in July 1999 and March 2000. The few individuals of native ants collected in the invaded zone belonged to cryptic species such as Hypoponera pruinosa , Hypoponera sp.

Collecting, observation, and experiments were used to study the extent and mechanisms of Wasmannia's success. Seventeen taxa of ants were collected, of which four were endemic, and most of the rest were well-known tropical tramp species. Current distribution of all species was determined. Greatest species diversity occurred in the arid zone, which was also the area of lowest Wasmannia density. Systematic collecting-transects showed that Wasmannia either exterminates or reduces to very low density all sympatric species on Santa Cruz. In many areas the ant fauna composition changes from 100 percent Wasmannia to 0 percent Wasmannia within 100 m. Experiments with artificial baits arranged in transects perpendicular to sharp boundaries showed that Wasmannia mobilized the greatest number of workers, was very successful in replacing other species, and remained the longest time at baits. Wasmannia ate primarily invertebrates, honeydew, and, in the hot season, plants parts. It was active 24 hr/day during three 24-hour periods. There were no central, intraspecifically defended nests. Nests were small and numerous. No intraspecific aggres- sion was ever observed, either under natural conditions or at bait stations. Wasmannia density increased with altitude up to near the summit of the island. The species is not presently found in either the driest or wettest parts of Santa Cruz. Currently no ant species occurs on Santa Cruz which can coexist with Wasmannia in zones of high Wasmannia density, Because Wasmannia occurs in high density and consumes a variety of invertebrate prey, it is probably causing major eco- system changes in invertebrate diversity and density.",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Clark et al_2007,2007,"Clark DB, Guayasamin C, Pazmino O, Donoso C, Paez de Villacis Y. 2007.

There was a striking contrast between ant communities in habitats where W aurop- unctata was present and absent (Table 2, Fig. 1). Wasmannia auropunctata was collected in all traps in the
infested area. Meanwhile, a low number of other ant species, P. fulva (1) and C. emery (14), were collected in the infested area. This co-occurrence was also reported by Clark et al. (1982) in certain areas of Santa Cruz Island where W. auropunctata was dominant during the wet season. In contrast, six species were collected from the uninfected area, including the two species found in the habitats occupied by W auropunctata. These species were C. planus, T. melanocephalum, H. beebe, and C. nuda. Although C. emery was dominant in the uninfected habitat, it was not numerically as dominant as W. auropunctata.... The results of the tests using the Margalef Diversity Index and the Shannon Weaver Index confirm that there was a greater species richness and equitability in areas where W auropunctata was absent. The values from the Margalef Diversity Index were 0.60 and 0.95 in the little fire ant-occupied area, while in the uninfected are a they were 1.97 and 2.15. A similar pattern was observed with the Shannon Weaver Index (0.01 in the infested area and 0.25 and 0.45 in the uninfected area). The total number of ants increased by about twenty times in the infested area due to the high density of W auropunctata individ- uals. On the other hand, representa tives of other ant species dropped by 90% and species richness declined by 50%, from 6 to 3 (Table 2).

When the 1976 census ofant species along the Puerto Ayora-Baltra Road (Clark et al. 1982) was repeated six years later, we found that although Wasmannia had not advanced northward (into the arid zone), it had spread south along the road into humid Scalesia forest at a rate of about 170 m per year (Fig. 1). As was found to be the case in the 1976 census, Wusmanniu overlapped with few or no other species of ants, except on those transects near the southern edge of its distribution, in areas that had been invaded since 1976 (Figs 1, 4). Wasmunnia occurred on 36 of the 90 transect sections (9 transects, each containing ten 10 m sections) and on 81% of these sections it occurred alone, not overlapping with any other species of ant. Only three other species occurred on more than one-third of the sections: Pheidole sp. A on 37 sections, Solenopsis sp. A on 43 and Paratrechina nesiotis (Wheeler) on 52 sections, each co-occurring with 1-5 other species of ants (with a median of 2.0-2.8 species). Paratrechina nesiolis occurred alone on only one transect section, while the other two species were never found alone. Only four other ant taxa were found in those areas where Wasmannia occurred in high densities: Solenopsis spp. A and B, Hypoponera sp. and Strumigenys sp., all hypogeic ants which were collected in soil samples. In six soil samples taken in the Giant Tortoise Reserve (Caseta, Fig. 1) on Santa Cruz, at 150 m elevation in lower transition zone vegetation, the average relative abundances of the different species were (Wasmanniu/Solenopsis/Hypoponeru) 1 /0.008/0.0006. Average relative abundances in five soil samples from the agricultural and lower Miconia- guava zone ( 180-430 m elevation) were ( Wasmannia/Solenopsis/Hypoponera/- Strumigenys) 1 /0.08/0.0 1 lO.001. The distribution of Wasmannia on San Salvador was patchier than on Santa Cruz..... In a census of ants along the NW boundary of Wasmannia at Guayabillos, Wasmannia occurred on six of the eight transects and on all ten sections of each of these six transects. On 80% of these sections (out of 60), Wasmannia occurred alone, not overlapping with any other species of ants..... A different distribution pattern was found in the agricultural zone of Santo Tomis and the nearby slopes of Volcin Sierra Negra and Cerro Grande on Isabela Island (Fig. 5). Wasmannia was restricted to a small area encompassing three farms at about 180-250m elevation, where it had been introduced between 1966 and 1967 in a shipment of clumps of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum). Wasmannia did not overlap in distribution with one of the ‘true’ fire ants, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius), and in fact, there appeared to be a ‘no- man’s-land’ of several meters between adjacent areas of these two species along their common boundary. Although widespread in the islands, Solenopsis geminata may have also been introduced to Volcan Sierra Negra by settlers, as it was not recorded from Isabela by earlier expeditions. Unlike Wasmannia, S. geminata overlapped with many other species of ants (up to nine other species in Santo Tomb), including many of the same species that were displaced by Wasmannia (e.g. Pheidole spp., Paratrechina nesiotis and Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander)). It remains unclear if the boundary between the two species is stable or if one is spreading at the expense of the other",4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Lubin_1984,1984,"Lubin YD. 1984.

At Guayabillos, on San Salvador I., the population density of scorpions was significantly lower in Wasmannia-infested areas, with 0.06 k 0.14 scorpions per m2 (mean & standard deviation; N = 25 plots, each 20 m2), than in adjacent non-infested areas, with 0.41 k0.23 scorpions/m2 (N = 18; t = 6.324, P < 0.001).

Along this transect, the density ofscorpions decreased from 0.55/m2 (no Wusmunnia groups) to 0.05/m2 (with 0.85 groups of Wusmunnia per m2).... At the Guayabillos and TrAgica sites on San Salvador Island, both the numbers of species of insects caught in sticky traps and their overall abundances were lower in Wusmunniu-infested areas than in non-infested areas (Table 3). The increase in numbers of individuals captured in traps (especially in tree- traps) at Triigica was due entirely to the emergence of large numbers of flies (Diptera) from a nearby temporary pond.

We tested the exploitation of: (1) food sources by placing baits on all trees with trunks greater than 5 cm in diameter; and (2) nesting sites on two tree species likely to shelter ant colonies. In non-invaded areas, the native ants occupied only 44.6% of the baits after 2 h of exposure, while in invaded areas all the baits were occupied by numerous W. auropunctata workers. Similarly, in non-invaded areas only 48.9% of Meryta coriacea (Araliaceae) trees and 64.5% of Basselinia pancheri (Arecaceae) sheltered ants, while in invaded areas W. auropunctata nested in 92.6-98.3% of these trees. Also, workers attended native Margarodidae (Hemiptera) for which they promoted the development of populations significantly larger than those attended by native ants. Thus native ants appear unable to efficiently exploit and defend several of the available food sources and nesting sites, providing a niche opportunity for an invader like W. auropunctata.... In total, 32 ant species belonging to 14 genera and four subfamilies were noted on the baits and sampled plants (Table 1). With the exception of W. auropunctata, all the other ant species were native to New Caledonia, the richest genus being Monomorium (eight species), followed by Paratrechina (five species) and Camponotus (four species)....

An assumed density of three nests of Wasmannia per m2 and 24 hr year-round activity ( see below ) leads to a projected consumption of 0.55 kg of solid foods (mostly invertebrates) per m2 per year in the transition zone. Sotme unknown proportion of the invertebrates are scavenged, but many instances of active predation were observed; W. auropunctata probably affects the native invertebrate fauna significantly, and may also affect higher trophic-level organisms such as birds and lizards that",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Clark et al_2007,2007,"Clark DB, Guayasamin C, Pazmino O, Donoso C, Paez de Villacis Y. 2007.

1097,547,Wasmannia auropunctata,French Guiana,,,,,,,,"We found ecologically heterogeneous populations of W. auropunctata coexisting in the species’ native geographical area. First, we found populations restricted to naturally perturbed areas (particularly floodplains) within the primary forest, and absent from the surrounding forest areas. These populations were characterised by low nest and worker densities. Second, we found dominant populations in recent anthropogenic areas (e.g. secondary forest or forest edge along road) characterised by high nest and worker densities, and associated with low ant species richness. The local dominance of W. auropunctata in such areas can be due to the displacement of other species (cause) or the filling-up of empty habitats unsuitable to other ants (effect). With respect to their demographic features and ant species richness, the populations of native anthropogenic habitats were to a large extent similar to the invasive populations introduced into remote areas..... In French Guiana, whereas the little fire ant was commonly recorded in the open land along roadsides to the forest edge, it was found to be at high (absolute) density in only 4 of the 40 transects. When present at high density, W. auropunctata workers monopolised almost all of the baits at all times, and a total of only eight other species ( Crematogaster limata Smith, F., Cr. tenuicula Forel, Odontomachus haematodus L., Pachycondyla sp., Pheidole spp., Pseudomyrmex termi- tarius Smith, and Solenopsis sp.) were occasionally recorded. In contrast, a considerably larger ant diversity was system- atically noted on the baits placed in the transects where W. auropunctata was present at low density (21 species in to- tal), or absent (36 species). A one-way anova shows that the mean number of species (excluding W. auropunctata ) was significantly different between the three levels of occurrence (2.0, 3.9, and 4.6 for transects with W. auropunctata at high density, low density and absent, respectively; F 2,37 = 4.09, P = 0.025). The significant positive association between the presence of W. auropunctata and the decrease of ant spe- cies richness was only due to the differences between the ‘high density’ and ‘absent’ transects (Tukey’s post-hoc test, p high density vs absent = 0.02, p high density vs low density = 0.14, and p low density vs absent = 0.51). The relationship between the presence of W. auropunctata and ant species richness was further studied in greater detail in a disturbed Guianian site . Wasmannia auropunctata was found to completely dominate a zone ranging from the edge to the first 20 m of the secondary forest ( Fig. 5a ). Numerous W. auropunctata workers were already present at the baits even after only 5 min. We did not detect any other ant species on any of the baits located 0, 5 and 10 m from the edge, and only a few hetero- specific workers were noted on the baits located 15 and 20 m away ( Fig. 5b ). The abundance of W. auropunctata was found to abruptly and drastically decrease on baits located 25 m away, and no workers were recorded further than 30 m away. Concomitantly, the abundance of foraging workers from other ant species increased considerably on baits located 25 to 40 m from the forest edge. The heterospecific workers recorded on the baits mainly belonged to the genera Pheidole , Solenopsis , Crematogaster , and Camponotus.

1112,562,Wasmannia auropunctata,Israel,Israel,,,,"The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, probably arrived in Israel in ca. 1998 and was identified in 2005; this is the first record of this species from open areas outside the tropics and subtropics…. At high densities they displaced almost all the local ant species sampled, affecting population abundances, species richness, and community structure. W. auropunctata seems to have a detrimental effect also on other ground arthropods, judging from the observed decline in spider and beetle abundances.... We studied W. auropunctata’s impact on three major local arthropod groups: ants, beetles, and spiders. The study was conducted during February–March 2006..... Spider abundances were signif- icantly lower at high densities of W. auropunctata,but the reduction in species richness was only marginally significant (Fig. 3; Table 6). A partial redundancy analysis showed that 48% of the variance was explained by high densities of W. auropunctata when locality served as covariable (F = 11.78, P = 0.006), and locality explained 23% of the variance when W. auropunctata’s density served as a covariable (F = 4.95, P = 0.048). In addition, the RDA analysis also showed that high densities of W. auropunctata had different impacts on different spider families in that the dominant spider family, Linyphiidae (67.85% of the individuals), was highly affected by high densities of the ant, compared to other families. Similar significant reductions in beetle abundances and species richness (Fig. 4; Table 7) were noted at high W. auropunctata densities, but the redundancy analysis (RDA) did not reveal any significant factors.",3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,0,3,,,Vonshak et al_2010,2010,"Vonshak M, Dayan T, Ionescu-Hirsh A, Freidberg A, Hefetz A. 2010.

1114,564,Wasmannia auropunctata,New Caledonia,New Caledonia,,,,,,,".... we compared resource use by ants in the understorey of an undisturbed New Caledonian rain forest recently invaded by the little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata. We tested the exploitation of: (1) food sources by placing baits on all trees with trunks greater than 5 cm in diameter; and (2) nesting sites on two tree species likely to shelter ant colonies. In non-invaded areas, the native ants occupied only 44.6% of the baits after 2 h of exposure, while in invaded areas all the baits were occupied by numerous W. auropunctata workers. Similarly, in non-invaded areas only 48.9% of Meryta coriacea (Araliaceae) trees and 64.5% of Basselinia pancheri (Arecaceae) sheltered ants, while in invaded areas W. auropunctata nested in 92.6-98.3% of these trees. Also, workers attended native Margarodidae (Hemiptera) for which they promoted the development of populations significantly larger than those attended by native ants. Thus native ants appear unable to efficiently exploit and defend several of the available food sources and nesting sites, providing a niche opportunity for an invader like W. auropunctata.... In total, 32 ant species belonging to 14 genera and four subfamilies were noted on the baits and sampled plants (Table 1). With the exception of W. auropunctata, all the other ant species were native to New Caledonia, the richest genus being Monomorium (eight species), followed by Paratrechina (five species) and Camponotus (four species).... After 1h of being installed, only 86 out of 350 baits (24.6%) placed in the non-invaded areas were occupied by ants belonging to 6 genera and 14 species (Table 2). Of the 291 baits remaining after 2 h (the others were robbed by lizards and birds), 127 (44.6%) were occupied by ants belonging to 10 genera and 24 species (comparison between 1 h and 2 h; Fisher's exact-test: FI = 26.04; df = 1; ant species sheltering in 48.9% of the 129 Meryta studied P < 0.01) (Table 2).... In the invaded area, all the baits were discovered by W. auropunctata workers within minutes, and rapidly occupied by numerous recruited nestmates (Table 2). No workers from native species were noted on these baits, but foraging Paratrechina sp. workers were observed once on a tree trunk. The mean number of W. auropunctata workers per bait varied from 53.3 after 1 h to more than 100 after 2 h.",4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,0,4,,,Le Breton et al_2005,2005,"Le Breton J, Jourdan H, Chazeau J, Orivel J, Dejean A. 2005.
